Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: research laboratory

Device or equipment involved: unknown

Procedure being performed: normal laboratory practices

How LAI / exposure occurred: The laboratorians thought that they were working with F. tularensis LVS, the avirulent vaccine strain. The laboratory culture was found to be contaminated with F. tularensis Type A, a virulent strain. The source of the contamination has not been identified. Specific procedures leading to LAI were not definitively identified. Laboratorians reported a wide array of laboratory activities, with differing frequencies. "There was wide variability in the use of protective equipment and infection control measures."

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: All three victims were treated with antibiotics and recovered. Epidemiologic survey was performed on personnel working in the vicinity of the laboratory during the time the cases were active. Only one other person reported symptoms related to those of tularemia, and that person was seronegative for tularemia. A large investigation took place after the event, culminating in this report, which has the following recommendations: 1. Retraining •BSL3 training for all tularemia researchers, provided by the State Laboratory Institute •Refresher training on laboratory safety for all other laboratory personnel on the 6th floor •Retraining on Select Agent requirements for appropriate personnel regarding protocols and handling •Consultation with BU Occupational Health Center for all workers regarding risks, illness reporting requirements, obtaining baseline serum, and vaccination as appropriate 2. Communication •IBC and IRC protocols provided to all workers by Principal Investigators ñ to be read and signed as understood 3. Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) and Infrastructure •Modification and strengthening of SOPs by any Principal Investigator who conducts work using a BSL2 and/or a BSL3 laboratory, in conjunction with an outside expert •Updating of SOPs by Principal Investigators for any laboratory activities that may cause aerosolization •Review of all laboratory equipment by the BPHC Office of EnvironmentalHealth and Safety, along with Principal Investigators

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The report mentions that availability of biosafety cabinets was "very limited." and "researchers cited routine failure to comply with safety protocols."

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: All three victims were treated with antibiotics and recovered. Tularemia was not diagnosed by the treating physician in any of the three cases.

Occupation(s) of affected personnel: virologist

Age(s) of affected personnel: 46

Agent(s) involved: Sabiá virus
find in Risk Group Databasearrow (NOTE: you may have to edit search to be more specific)

Biological Safety Level (BSL) for work being performed?: BSL-3

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: research laboratory

Device or equipment involved: centrifuge

Procedure being performed: High-speed centrifugation to clarify a harvest of infected Vero cells containing Sabiá virus.

How LAI / exposure occurred: At the end of the centrifugation process, after opening the lid of the rotor, the virologist noted that the outside of one centrifuge bottle was wet and that fluid had leaked into the bottom of the rotor. The LAI probably occurred when the centrifuge rotor was opened and the leak from the centrifuge bottles was observed or during the decontamination process (aerosol transmission).

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Wrap around gown, Single pair of protective gloves, Other PPE,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Other engineering control,

Follow-up procedures taken: The virologist decontaminated the rotor, the inside and outside of the bottle that had leaked and the spillage with a concentrated solution of sodium hypochlorite (5.25 percent). The combined bleach and liquid in the rotor were then absorbed with paper towels. All his personal protective equipment as well as the contaminated material in the laboratory were autoclaved.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The virologist could have worn a positive air-purifying respirator during the decontamination of the rotor.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: After PCR confirmation of infection with Sabiá virus, the patient was transferred to a negative-pressure isolation suite. All materials removed from the isolation suite were autoclaved, and incinerated. All persons entering the patient’s room and laboratory workers processing the patient’s specimens used fit-tested masks with high-efficiency particulate air filters, gowns, and gloves. All specimens were double bagged and carried by hand to the laboratories. Clinical laboratory specimens were processed to minimize workers’ exposure to aerosolized virus, and routine automated equipment for chemistry specimens was not used unless the specimen was first treated with Triton X-100 to inactivate the virus. Others laboratory tests were carried out within a biosafety cabinet. All contacts of the patient were identified and enrolled in a medical-surveillance program for a six-week follow-up period.

Biological Safety Level (BSL) for work being performed?:

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Laboratory

Device or equipment involved: Broken ampule

Procedure being performed: Freeze drying samples

How LAI / exposure occurred: A 28-year-old man (researcher) who was freeze-drying BPXV isolates in a laboratory in Hisar, India sustained a cut on his right palm through nitrile gloves by accidental piercing of shrapnel from a broken ampule. The virus being freeze-dried (10-5.5 50% tissue culture infectious doses/mL) was isolated from a buffalo in Jalgaon, India, in 2010.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Single pair of protective gloves,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure:

Follow-up procedures taken: As a follow-up measure, the freeze drying procedure was reviewed and the pre-freezing temperature was reduced to –60°C. Measures were also taken to ensure use of better-quality ampules. Surgical and contact material associated with the lesion was placed in biohazard bags for autoclaving before disposal. In addition, laboratory and hospital staff was apprised of the risk associated with BPXV transmission.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Reporting of laboratory-acquired infections is crucial because infections could also spread to other personnel. Strict biosafety practices and laboratory guidelines are useful in minimizing laboratory-acquired infections. Guidelines, no matter how stringent, are not sufficient on their own. Laboratory-acquired infections occur because humans or machines are not infallible. Thus, laboratories should have emergency procedures in place to deal with such situations.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: The injured site on the palm was immediately cleaned with 70% ethanol and treated with povidone-iodine solution. No untoward reaction was observed <2 days postinjury. Erythema appeared at the injury site on postinjury day 3. Subsequently, a small vesicle developed on postinjury day 5. This vesicle progressed into a pustule with a central area of necrosis by postinjury day 7. On postinjury day 9, symptoms worsened (onset of high fever and general malaise and pain at the affected site), and the researcher sought medical care. Physical examination showed high fever (104°F), unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy, and edema of the palm. Amoxicillin (500 mg, 2×/d), cephalexin (500 mg, 2×/d), and analgesic/antipyretic (paracetamol, 500 mg, 2×/d) were prescribed to control secondary complications caused by bacterial infection and pain.The next day, the entire palm became cyanotic and edema increased. The researcher was then referred to a specialty hospital where the lesion was surgically excised on postinjury day 11 under axial block anesthesia. Blood, necrotic tissue, pustular material, and swab specimens were obtained for laboratory examination. Postsurgery treatment included cleaning of the surgical site on alternate days and oral medication (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, 625 mg; ibuprofen, 400 mg; paracetamol, 325 mg; and rabeprazole, 20 mg) for 5 days. On postinjury day 19, the surgeon advised the patient to take cefuroxime (500 mg/d for 5 days) and use a topical ointment containing mupirocin to prevent a delay in healing.

Biological Safety Level (BSL) for work being performed?: BSL-2

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: research laboratory

Device or equipment involved: needlestick

Procedure being performed: during filtration of a virus stock for infection of mosquito cells with DENV-2

How LAI / exposure occurred: A capped needle was removed from a 10 ml syringe, and Dengue virus was drawn up in the syringe from a 50 ml tube. A disposable filter was attached to the syringe, and the preparation was filtered. Repetition of the process led to lower levels in the 50 ml tube, so the filter was removed and the capped needle was re-attached to the syringe and then uncapped and used to draw up the virus into the syringe. To remove the needle in order to re-attach the filter, re-capping was attempted and resulted in the needlestick. This is the first dengue transmission by needlestick in a research laboratory, and this open-access article has images of how the incident occurred.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure:

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Biological safety cabinet,

Follow-up procedures taken: The authors recommend changing the WHO manual language from "minimize using syringes and needles" to "syringes and needles must not be used when in a situation where there use is not directly indicated." Re-capping was prohibited, but the authors noted the lack of a sharps container for disposal. First aid kits will be provided and monitored.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The investigation revealed that the syringe alone, or a pipet, should have been used to suction virus. An explicit SOP may have prevented the use of a needle. The authors recommend reinforcement of biosafety measures.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: The technician washed the wound with running water. There is no post exposure prophylaxis for Dengue virus. The technician continued to work in the research lab where all 4 serotypes were handled until the assay she did herself, daily, became positive on day 10; symptoms began on day 9. The authors refer to literature indicating that infection with a second serotype could result in a more severe outcome, and believe that exposed staff should not continue to work until a definite diagnosis is made. The individual who had the LAI was re-assigned to prevent a secondary infection and, possibly, severe dengue infection.

Biological Safety Level (BSL) for work being performed?: BSL-2

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: research laboratory

Device or equipment involved: unknown

Procedure being performed: Possible causes are bitten by escaped mosquito during feeding experiment, aerosol generating procedures done outside a bio safety cabinet

How LAI / exposure occurred: 'The investigations carried out in response to the case did not conclusively determine the specific route by which the patient was infected with DENV-2. It was noted that, although the majority of procedures involving live virus were performed in a class II biological safety cabinet (BSC), some aspects of the experiments were, by necessity, conducted on the bench outside the BSC. It was during this process that the patient may have been exposed to the virus within aerosolized blood droplets, resulting in mucocutaneous transmission, or perhaps may have become infected via contact through an unrecognized dermal abrasion Alternatively, theroute of exposure may have been via mosquito bite, as the patient reported being bitten by an unengorged mosquito that had escaped during the feeding period. Even if the mosquito had only probed the blood/virus mixture without feeding, or had even imbibed a small amount of the mixture, there would not have been sufficient time for the virus to replicate in the mosquito before transmission. Nonetheless, mechanical transmission of the virus via contaminated mosquito mouthparts cannot be completely excluded, as this phenomenon has been demonstrated previously with DENVs'.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Safety glasses, Lab coat, Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Biological safety cabinet,

Follow-up procedures taken: The researchers' serology indicated antibody response to the same strain used in the experiments.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: From the article: ' The LAI also highlights the importance of appropriate laboratory practices for containing infected mosquitoes and preventing contact with potentially infectious material, including the generation of potentially infectious aerosols. The use of personal protective equipment, including face mask and eye protection, and where possible, conducting all manipulations using live virus within a class II BSC, would be appropriate for prevention of laboratory-acquired arbovirus infections'

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: none. 'After 3 days in hospital, the patient was discharged and within 48 hours all symptoms had resolved and the results of laboratory tests had returned to normal'

Biological Safety Level (BSL) for work being performed?: unknown

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: US state and territorial mycobacteriology laboratories

Device or equipment involved: one was a needlestick; 2 were due to faulty HVAC and no negative pressure;

Procedure being performed: 6 of 7 confirmed cases were mycobateriology bench workers (four were infected while performing tasks associated with isolation procedures. These tasks included inoculum preparation, medium inoculation, and equipment maintenance, 1 was performing PCR); one was a equipment technician

How LAI / exposure occurred: Among the 49 laboratories that responded to the questionnaire, 13 (26.5%) (12 state laboratories and 1 territorial laboratory) reported TST conversions among their mycobacteriology laboratory personnel. From these 13 laboratories, a total of 21 employees were positive for TST conversion. Follow-up calls were made to the 13 laboratories to determine if converters were evaluated for suspected laboratory-acquired exposures. Seven of the 21 infections were determined to be laboratory acquired based on each laboratory’s evaluation of an employee’s occupational position, duties, and history and on a review of medical records. In six of the 21 cases, the source of infection could not be determined. One case was attributed to an accidental needle-stick injury. None of the TST converters identified developed active tuberculosis. Six of the seven were mycobacteriology laboratory bench workers, and one was an equipment technician. The average age of all 21 TST converters was 40 years (range, 25 to 59). The average age of those with confirmed laboratory-acquired infections was 38 years (range, 25 to 56). Of the seven converters identified as having acquired their infections in the laboratory, four were infected while performing tasks associated with isolation procedures. These tasks included inoculum preparation, medium inoculation, and equipment maintenance. Other factors identified as contributing to acquiring laboratory-associated infection included handling a high volume of specimens and working with inadequate ventilation. In one laboratory, it was determined that two mycobacteriologists were infected with M. tuberculosis because of a faulty exhaust system that compromised the negative pressure required to prevent the spread of contaminated air to uncontaminated areas. Another mycobacteriologist became infected while performing the PCR procedure, although the specific task associated with the procedure was not defined.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: The authors suggest improvements to risk assessments and frequency of testing. (annual, biannual, or varies by job category).

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Protocols were not always in place for identifying and managing workers who may have laboratory acquired infections. Assessments of occupational tuberculosis transmission should be based on epidemiologic evaluations, and results should be documented on standardized forms or in employee records so that further study or appropriate follow-up of employee conditions may be performed. TST and risk assessments are recommended at 3-, 6-, or 12-month intervals to evaluate appropriate interventions.

How LAI / exposure occurred: Case 1, Laboratory 1: Worked during the holiday weekend of a county fair E. coli O157:H7 outbreak. She wore gloves intermittently throughout the day, and her laboratory coat remained open. This case was the laboratorian responsible for the identification of E. coli O157:H7 isolates that included handling of agar plates, use of an automated identification system, and performance of slide latex agglutination. Vortexing of E. coli O157:H7 suspensions was performed on the laboratory bench top without latex gloves being worn and the laboratory telephone was answered both with and without latex gloves being worn. Hands were not washed each time that the gloves were removed, although they were always washed prior to exit form the laboratory. Case 2, Laboratory 2:Case 2 always wore latex gloves and a buttoned laboratory coat when working with isolates, changed gloves frequently, and always washed her hands after each glove removal. Case 2, wearing gloves, made a suspension of E. coli O157:H7 with a swab and vortexed the tube on the bench top. Gloves were removed prior to computer and telephone use. Durign this time period, students were undergoing training in the laboratory. Case 3, Laboratory 3: Case 3 did not wear latex gloves, but she always wore a buttoned laboratory coat. She only made isolation and subculture. Two coworkers manipulated the same isolate throughout this time period, one of whom wore latex gloves while using the computer and while turning faucet handles of a laboratory sink. These individuals did not routinely wash their hands after the removal of their latex gloves. Case 4, Laboratory 4: Case 4 always wore latex gloves and butoned laboratory coat. This laboratory worked performed a latex agglutination test to identify the E. coli isolate. Vortexing was not performed and shw wore latex gloves while aswering the telephone and using the computer. Her hands were washed each time that the gloves were removed.

Follow-up procedures taken: Unknown

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Specific guidelines recommend that latex gloves must be worn when hands may come in contact with potentially infectious materials. if gloves are worn during a laboratory procedure and then not appropriately removed, substantial risk exists for cross-contamination of surfaces and items. Gloves should be discarded after the procedure is completed, or if they become contaminated during the procedure. Hands should be washed thoroughly after each removal of gloves. Phones and computers should be used only after latex gloves have been removed and hands have been washed. In addition, procedures with aerosol or high splash potential, such as the vortexing of suspensions of infectious organisms, should be conducted in a biological safety cabinet.

Biological Safety Level (BSL) for work being performed?: unknown

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: The LAI was reported at a community college. The Salmonella isolates from the stool specimens of the two patients were found to be indistinguishable from the specimen that was used in the microbiology class.

Device or equipment involved: It's unknown what PPE or devices were used during the LAI/exposure. A survey on laboratory practices emailed to the students, 14 reposnded saying that 4 always wore gloves, 6 wore gloves sometimes and 2 rarely wore gloves.

Procedure being performed: Unclear if the exposure occurred during direct handling of Salmonella culture, spill, or contaminated equipment.

How LAI / exposure occurred: The current MMWR report briefly describes two cases of Salmonellosis that occurred in 2013 in a community college at Maine, USA. The two cases reported were of students who were taking a microbiology class. The Salmonella isolate from the two cases was indistinguishable by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis from a specimen used in the microbiology class. Both the clinical and laboratory class isolate also showed a PFGE pattern indistinguishable from the national Salmonella Typhimurium outbreak in 2010 that occurred in clinical and teaching microbiology laboratories. The exact source of LAI/exposure was unknown but could've been from direct handling of Salmonella culture, a spill, or contaminated equipment. It was noted in the report that the usage of Salmonella at teaching level is contrary to the biologic safety guidelines issued in 2012 by the American Society for Microbiology which states that students should be competent performing BSL-1 activities before BSL-2 work.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Health and Environmental Testing Laboratory (HETL), determined the clinical Salmonella isolated from stool specimen provided by outside hospital laboratories by PFGE analysis. HETL visited the college to assess laboratory practices and discuss PFGE results. A laboratory practices survey was conducted which had a low response rate.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The students should have been properly trained to do BSL-2 activities. Salmonella should not have been used at the teaching level of this community college in the first place. A laboratory practices survey conducted identified several potential contamination hazards. Potential contamination hazards listed below could've been eliminated to prevent exposure: equipment was noted to be in disrepair inconsistent use of PPE, problems with hand hygiene, inappropriate storage and handling of laboratory coats and use of personal items in the laboratory.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Microbiology Laboratory

Device or equipment involved: Lack of biosafety cabinet

Procedure being performed: Reading plates, making subcultures on agar plates, and performing serogroup identification at the bench

How LAI / exposure occurred: Case 1: Preparation of Gram stain from blood culture of patient later shown to have meningococcal disease; handling and subculturing of agar plates containing cerebrospinal fluid cultures from same patient. "Aspiration of materials from blood culture bottles was performed at the open laboratory bench; biosafety cabinets, eye protection, or masks were not used routinely for this procedure." Case 2: Handling of several N. meningitidis serogroup C isolates. Worker performed slide agglutination testing and recorded colonial morphology under typical BSL2 precautions but without the use of a biosafety cabinet. All 16 cases: Procedures performed included reading plates (50%), making subcultures on agar plates (50%), and performing serogroup identification at the bench (38%). "In 15 of the 16 cases, the laboratory reportedly did not perform procedures within a biosafety cabinet."

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Case 1: Pulsed-field gel ecetrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocal enzyme electrophoresis (MEE) testing at CDC to compare patient and clinical isolates. Case 2: PFGE testing at the state public health laboratory and CDC To detect additional cases, a request was sent to various listservs for probable cases of laboratory-acquired meningococcal disease. Probable cases were defined as patients who had occupational exposure to a N. meningitidis isolate during the 14 days prior to the onset of illness and whose serogroup matched that of the source isolate. the CDC received an additional 14 reports of probable laboratory-acquired meningococcal disease which they investigated.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: "Although the exact mechanism of transmission in the laboratory setting is unclear, use of a biosafety cabinet during manipulation of sterile site isolates of N. meningitidis would ensure protection." The authors also suggest alternative methods of protection pending assessment (i.e. splash guards and masks), minimizing isolate manipulation or sending specimens to other laboratories if a biosafety cabinet is unavailable, educating microbiologists in and strict adherence to safety precautions, reassessing handling of N. meningitidis, and making informed decisions about vaccination.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: research laboratory

Device or equipment involved: unknown

Procedure being performed: Cell infections

How LAI / exposure occurred: The precise mechanism of contamination is unknown in this case. However, the evidence suggested that the West Nile inoculum used by the student, was contaminated with SARS virus. When the student inoculated cells with this sample, both viruses grew simultaneously. A laboratory technician helped him with the infections. The transmission might have occurred as the result of an error made by the student, the laboratory technician, or both.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Wrap around gown, Double pair of protective gloves,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Biological safety cabinet,

Follow-up procedures taken: The patient was transferred to an isolation facility. Both laboratories where the patient had worked were closed as a precautionary measure. The laboratory where the transmission occurred was extensively disinfected. All contacts were identified and placed under home quarantine.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The student should have received appropriate training prior entering the BSL-3 laboratory; he received only 20 minutes of trainiing. He was working with attenuated Sarafend strain of West Nile virus in a level 2 laboratory. An arrangement was made for him to use a level 3 lab to grow a more pathogenic strain of West Nile virus, the New York strain, in order to make comparisons. The technician who inoculated the flasks also worked with SARS CoV. Two T75 flasks infected with West Nile were centrifuged in one 50 ml tube, and, removed from tube from the protective container in the centrifuge in the open laboratory and placed the tube in the hood. the student was standing there in street clothes. The student later reentered, wearing PPE, and aliquoted the samples in the hood. The samples were frozen, and 3 days later the student was ill. SARS CoV and West Nile were present in the vials.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: 2 handled infected heifers; 1 in the laboratory

Device or equipment involved:

Procedure being performed: case 1 and 2 handled 4 experimentally infected heifers; case 3 was harvesting infected allantoic fluids (virus is grown in eggs).

How LAI / exposure occurred: No specific details are available for case 1 and 2, other than that they both handled the same 4 experimentally infected heifers on the same days as case 1. Case 3 was spattered with virus containing material while harvesting allantoic fluids from infected eggs. The virus was not isolated from patient samples, but all 3 cases were confirmed to be due to Vesicular Stomatitis Virus, New Jersey type, by serum neutralization assays. Onset of disease was prompt -30 hours after exposure for case 1 and 2; 48 hours after exposure for case 3. In two of the cases - the disease was biphasic - symptoms or high fever, muscle pains, etc. cleared, and then returned for a second bout of acute illness. The author states that this report substantiates previous anecdotal reports that VSV can be transmitted to man from infected calves. 12 other staff members - some also had contact with the heifers, and some just candled eggs, did not have antibodies. HOWEVER- 2 BECAME ILL LATER. An addendum says that the laboratory had 2 more LAI prior to publication; serum antibody titers were over 1:1,000 to VSV. However, only one had an acute illness - the other infection was asymptomatic.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: This is not stated. The articles closes with a description of the 3 cases: two of the three cases had mild stomatitis, and one had "suggestive pneumonitis at the height of the febrile period." All 3 had The article states that all of the infected staff recovered uneventfully except for a "somewhat prolonged case of fatigue in convalescence." BUT THERE IS AN ADDENDUM: The follow-up was presumably not prompt enough. Two more staff members became infected prior to publication - 1 was acutely, 1 was symptomatic - both had serum antibody titers to VSV over 1:1000.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: No details are provided on the prevention methods in use or the whether the infected heifers were in an animal facility or a barn. However, use of PPE, including respiratory protection, would be considered appropriate today, along with provision of showering/hand washing facilities. A risk assessment for spatter from infected eggs would restrict the work to a biosafety cabinet and the use of Biosafety Level 3 practices.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Post-exposure prophylaxis was not available.

How LAI / exposure occurred: Case 1: He had worked with herpes simplex, influenza, and measles viruses, while other members of the laboratory staff were studying Treponema pallidum, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and the L1 serovar of C. trachomatis. Case 2: Worker that had been working for the previous six months in the same laboratory as Case 1. Unknown. Case 3: Worker got sick after three days of sonicating LGV organisms of the L2 serovar. Case 4: The investigation had been working with C. trachomatis inactivated by ultraviolet light for two years and had begun sonicationg large quantities of live strains of serovar L2 two months before the onset of symptoms. His serum was used repeatedly as a normal control reagent in antigenic analysis of C. trachomatis by gel immunoradioassay. Only after serologic conversion had been unexpectedly demonstrated in this assay was the possibility of C. trachomatis infection entertained. Subsequently, serum samples were therefore analyzed for antibodies to C. trachomatis by microimmunofluorescence, and the results were diagnostic of acute C. trachomatis infection. Serum samples obtained both before and after illness contained antibody to M. pneumoniae. Case 5: The patient´s work had involved the inoculation of yolk sacs and the harvesting of LGV organisms from yolk sacs by homogenization. In her laboratory, harvesting of LGV from egg-yolk sac was routinely performed in a hood, although not of the laminar-flow biosafety type. In addition, the patient often agitated LGV suspensions on a bench-top mixer for use as antigens.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: In three laboratories crude preparations of the organism grown in cell cultures were sonicated from 10 to 20 seconds to free the sonication-resistant elementary bodies from infected cell material. None of the laboratories used shielded ultrasonic probes or appropriate biosafety hoods routinely for purification. Infected individuals had the following procedures for diagnosis:CBC, chest x-rays, thoracotomy, complement fixation titer, monospot, microimmunofluoresence, CT scan, mediastinoscopy,

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Based on the authors experience, sonication of serovars L1 and L2 should be performed only in a biosafety cabinet with use of a shielded ultra-sonic probe, and other procedures that might lead to aerosol formation should also be performed withing a biosafety hood. Thus, microbiologic laboratories involved in activities that could create aerosols of LGV strains of C. trachomatis (or aerosols of C. psittaci) should ideally adopt the practices and containment equipment of Biosafety Level 3, as stated in the guidelines of the CDC.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Case 1: 200 mg of doxycycline daily, and within three days the fever had disappeared. After a one-month course of doxycycline, he totally recovered. Case 2: This patient was given a seven-day course of penicillin, and there was a slight improvement in her symptoms, When penicillin was discontinued, however, her symptoms recurred, and she was seen by the physician who cared for Case 1. The patient was treated with 200 mg of doxycycline daily for one month and returned to normal health. Case 3: (Hospitalized patient). The patient began a course of tetracycline hydrochloric acid (500 mg four times daily) for one month. Case 4: The patient was treated with 500 mg of erythromycin base four times daily for 10 days. Case 5: Erythromycin (250 mg four times for 10 days)

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The use of diphasic media would reduce repeat culturing and minimize the potential for direct contact with the organism. Work with infective organisms like brucella should only be conducted in specially designed safety cabinets.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: 1. Treated with doxycycline 200 mg/day for 10 weeks and with streptomycin 1 g/day for the first 3 weeks. No relapse and was symptom free at follow-up. 2. Treated with a combination of co-trimoxazole, 3 tab twice daily for three weeks and tetracycline, 500 mg four times daily for six weeks. Condition improved and became symptom free with no relapse at follow-up. 3. Treatment with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for six weeks and streptomycin 7.50 mg/day for the first 3 weeks. 4. Treated with co-trimoxazole for six weeks and with rifampicin for three weeks. Due to partial improvement in symptoms, treatment was changed to a combination of tetracyline 500 mg four times daily, for six weeks and streptomycin 1 gm/day for three weeks. Symptoms disappeared and no relapse was recorded during the follow-up.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Laboratory acquired disease, as in this case, can be prevented by strict adherence to the precautions listed for biosafety level 3.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: The patient was initially treated with rifampicin and doxycycline. Subsequent sensitivity testing showed resistance in infectious diseases to rifampicin. Antibiotic treatment was therefore changed to co-trimoxazole and doxycycline so that patient could complete a six week course of treatment. Medical follow up at four weeks showed that the patient had no fever, IgM titres had fallen, inflammatory markers were lower, and standard biochemical liver function tests yielded normal results.

How LAI / exposure occurred: Individual had worked in various areas of the organisation (but never in the Tuberculosis Department) from 1941 until he was transferred to the BCG Department in Nov 1970.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: At the beginning of 1975, the patient was referred to the chest clinic by his own physician because of certain symptoms. In Feb, an X-ray of the lungs showed a round infiltration approximately 5 cm in diameter at the back of the right lobe (at the same site as in 1966*) The latter condition was interpreted as an indication of outgrowth from the tumour. *From 1949, he was included consistently in the annual X-ray examination. After transfer to the BCG Department he should have had his lungs checked every 3 months but his participation was not regular. He was vaccinated with BCG in 1944, 1949 and 1951. In 1955, he had transient, possibly pathological X-ray findings in the lower hilar region of the right lung, accompanied by fatigue and weight loss. All other examinations at the chest clinic revealed no abnormalities until 1966 when, without previous symptoms, infiltrations were found first time behind the right costa I and in intercostal space I. No anti-tuberculosis treatment instituted. Not permitted to work for six weeks - sputum samples were negative (microscopy and culture). On the basis of repeated X-ray exams a diagnosis of lung tumour and suspected tuberculosis infiltration was made. Diagnosis following investigation revealed planocellular carcinoma in the posterior region of the upper and lower loves (second and sixth segments). The BCG-induced tuberculosis lung process that was verified bacteriologically in 1975 may either have developed from a metastatic lesion following the BCG vaccinations in 1944, 1949, and 1951 or have originated from an aerogenic infection during the production of BCG vaccine.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Stricter control of the personnel should be enforced so that failure to report for examination at the chest clinic does not occur. On the basis of a single case, changes in procedure in the BCG Department cannot be justified.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Following pneumonectomy in March 1975, a daily regime of 300mg isoniazid and 450mg rifampicin was started for a year.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Clinical laboratory

Device or equipment involved: Unknown

Procedure being performed: Case 1: Unknown; Case 2: Clinical isolate; Case 3: Processing cultures

How LAI / exposure occurred: Case 1: The laboratory technologist presented to her clinician with signs of severe malaise, fever and mild diarrhoea. The technologist had six years of working experience in microbiology laboratory. The patient had received Salmonella Typhi vaccination nine months earlier as part of an occupational health program. Further investigation founded that this vaccine was part of a batch recalled by the manufacturer, because of potentially low antigen content. Case 2: A clinical pathology resident working on the stool bench at a clinical microbiology laboratory, presented to a physician with fever, nausea and vomiting. The patient was admitted to hospital and discharged three days later. Further investigation revealed that the patient had recently serotyped a clinical isolate of Salmonella Typhi in the laboratory and had not work gloves at the time. This patient had one year of working experience in a clinical microbiology laboratory and had not been vaccinated against Salmonella Typhi. Case 3: A laboratory technologist working a clinical microbiology laboratory started complaining of headaches at work. His colleagues offered him an over the counter analgesic but his symptoms persisted. He reported to a hospital emergency room with symptoms of diarrohoea, worsening headaches, temperatures of 39°C and severe malaise; he was admitted into hospital. The patient had 28 months working experience in a clinical microbiology laboratory and had no history of vaccination against typhoid fever. Epidemiological investigation determined that the technologist had been exposed to Salmonella Typhi while processing a culture of Salmonella Typhi.

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Case 1: Blood cultures were collected for laboratory testing. The diagnostic laboratory identified the pathogen using MALDI Biotyper. Case 2: The isolate was referred to the CED for confirmation and identification. Case 3: Blood chemistry revealed raised liver enzymes and a C-reactive protein reading of 90 mg/L. Blood cultures were collected for laboratory testing; Salmonella Typhi was cultured. The diagnostic laboratory determined that the isolate was susceptible to ceftriaxone and the fluoroquinolones (Kirby-Bauer disk susceptibility testing method - pefloxacin disk screening zone size of 25 mm). The CED confirmed Salmonella Typhi identification and determined that the isolate was intermediately-resistant to fluoroquinolones and susceptible to azithromycin. Identification of typhoid fever cases and public health repsonse Laboratory networks report the isolation of Salmonella Typhi to the Outbreak Response Unit of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), who in turn notify the district and provincial communicable diseases coordinators. Cases are investigated through a home visit, interviewed and a case investigation form is completed. Cases are later followed up and include further testing of stool samples. For persons who have had contact with cases, their symptoms are assessed and stoll samples are also collected for testing.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: This article highlights the issues concerting the misdiagnosis and misreporting of Salmonella Typhi isolate as typhoid fever is a notifiable disease in most countris including South Africa. Therefore a rapid diagnosis and reporting to the health authorities is vital to ensure appropriate investigation including follow up of the patient and tracing the patient´s contacts, as well as to design interventions to avert any potential outbreak. All the presented cases were most likely the result of lapses in good laboratory practice and laboratory safety. Lapses in laboratory safety do occur, even among laboratory workers with many years of experience working in a clinical microbiology laboratory. Today, clinical microbiology laboratories in most countries enforce uniform safety policies nationwide, wich would include: safety training; restricted laboratory access; use of biological safety cabinets; personal protective equipment; hand-washing facilities with automatic-operating taps or elbow operating taps and automatic-operating paper towel dispensers; prohibiting eating, drinking and smoking in the laboratory; prohibiting cell phones in the laboratory; proper decontamination of laboratory benches before and after working with clinical specimens and bacterial cultures. Laboratory-acquired infection of Salmonella Typhi is uncommon, as the risk of infection is low if appropriate laboratory safety policies are in place and adhered to. Nonetheless, accidental infections still do occur and would most likely be the result of lapses in aseptic techniques. In these situations, molecular subtyping of bacterial isolates is very useful to investigate the source of infections. Laboratory accreditation to International Organization for Standarization (ISO) requirements ensures compliance and audit safety policies; diagnostic laboratories in South Africa are all accredited against the ISO 15189 standard. With regards to the use of biological safety cabinets, in South Africa (and most of African Countries), these are not mandatory for working with Salmonella Typhi. However, for some laboratories in Europe and the USA, it is mandatory for working with Salmonella Typhi.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Case 1: Patient was treated with seven days of oral ciprofloxacin. As the Centre for Enteric Diseases (CED) identified the resistance to floroquinolones the patient was then treated with a combination of azithromycin and fluoroquinolone for 14 days. Case 2: The CED confirmed Salmonella Typhi with susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and azithromycin. The patient responded well to levofloxacin therapy. Case 3: The patient was commenced on intravenous ciprofloxacin by the treating physician. He received seven days of intravenous ciprofloxacin followed up by a seven-day course of oral ciprofloxacin on discharge. As Salmonella Typhi with the same MICs was isolated from subsequent stool samples, collected 16 days and 19 days after the blood culture sample tested positive the patient was contacted by the treating private physician and readmited to hospital where he received five days of intravenous azithromycin. On discharge he was prescribed combination therapy comprising of oral ciprofloxacin and azithromycin for one month.

Procedure being performed: Working with a thymidine-kinase deficient strain of Vaccinia virus

How LAI / exposure occurred: On 1 February, 2003, a 48-year-old female research laboratory technician presented to hospital with a 5-day history of pain and blistering lesions on her right index finger. The patient, who had a long history of eczema in both hands, had developed severe pain and redness over the dorsal aspect of her index finger 5 days before of admission. She had noted a cut on the dorsal surface of her index finger at the second distal interphalangeal joint the previous week. Twho days before admission she developed a vesicular rash on the finger, with yellowish fluid draining from some of the vesicles. Because the persistent pain and swelling in her finger, she sought treatment in the emergency department. She had been working with a thymidine-kinase deficient strain of vaccinia virus, for use as a vector for gene therapy. In the weeks before presentation but was uncertain as to the last time she had worked with the virus. She did not report an episode of accidental inoculation. She usually wore no protective gloves, as this exacerbated her eczema. She had been vaccinated with smallpox vaccine as a child but not before beginning her laboratory work with vaccinia.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Not worn (specifically stated in article)

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: The diagnosis of vaccinia infection was confirmed by direct electron microscopy of fluid from the vesicle and isolation of vaccinia virus. The patient´s lesions were kept under a occlusive dressing. With clinical improvement on the second day of hospitalization, the patient was discharged home. She received dressing changes through home care services, and the lesions eventually healed.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: This report emphasizes the risk for laboratory Vaccinia virus, the immunizing agent in smallpox vaccine, that has a broad host range under experimental conditions and is rarely isolated from animals outside the laboratory in staff who work with vaccinia virus. The fact that the patient was not wearing gloves raises the question of adherence to laboratory safety procedures in research laboratories where researchers work with virulent pathogens. In addition, this report serves as a remider of the importance of mantaining appropriate infection control precautions when dealing with cutaneous vaccinia infeccion. Secondary transmission of recombinant vaccinia to healthcare workers, however, has not been reported. Because of the smaller volume and lower titre of virus in clinical specimens compared with laboratory materials, the risk of infection to healthcare workers may be lower than the risk to exposed laboratory workers, particularly when appropriate infection control precautions are followed. Immunization with smallpox vaccine is recommended for laboratory workers who work with vaccinia and this report serves as a reminder of the potential virulence of the vaccinia virus and the need to maintain careful precautions against cutaneous vaccinia infection.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: At the time that the patient had marked swelling and redness in her hand as well as a reactive axiliary lymph node and lympangitis, she was treated with intravenous penicillin for cellulitis due to presumptive group A Streptococcus, and following culture of Staphylococcus aureus from a superficial swab her treatment was switched to cloxicillin. The symptoms persisted, and she was eventually referred to the infectious diseases service, where a history of possible exposure to the vaccinia virus was elicited.

How LAI / exposure occurred: A immunology graduate student born after the discontinuation of routine smallpox vaccination was working with multiple strains of vaccinia as part of her thesis research. She had voluntarily declined vaccination beore beginning laboratory work with vaccinia. One morning in October 2004, she noticed the onset of itching, tearing, palpebral swelling, and conjuntival injection in her left eye.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Safety glasses, Lab coat,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing at the Pennsylvania Bureau of Laboratories showed evidence of vaccinia. Results were confirmed at the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention (CDC). At this time, vaccinia immune globulin (VIG), 6,000 U/kg IV, was administred.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: A public health investigation of the patient´s home and work contacts and the research laboratory was initiated. In addition a laboratory inspection, which included a review of experiments performed by the patient during the week before symptom onset, was conducted. Although laboratory staff generally followed established biosafety precautions; review of laboratory practices showed several opportunities for virus exposure. Staff infrequently wore eye protection while performing experiments with vaccinia. Laboratory coat sleeves were not elasticized and did not always cover the wrist. Waste pipettes were not disinfected before removal from the biosafety cabinet. Instances occurred in which samples with low titres of live virus were removed from the biosafety cabinet, transported to other parts of the facility, and manipulated. In addition, laboratory staff routinely vortexed tubes containing live virus outside the biosafety cabinet. Most important, no laboratory workers had been vaccinated in the past 10 years, as recommended by CDC. Biosafety level 2 precautions are recommended for laboratories and persons who manipulate nonattenuated strains of vacciniavirus. This recommendation assumes a priori that all such persons will be adequately vaccinated against the virus. In case that vaccination is impossible, workers should implement more stringent biosafety practices, such as consistently using goggles and performing all manipulations of virus in the biosafety cabinet.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Viral conjuntivitis was diagnosed by her student health services, and over-the-counter tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride eye drops were prescribed. After the diagnosis of vaccinia was confirmed at the eye hospital, the patient started on trifluridine and bacitracin ointments, broad-spectrum systemic antimicrobial agents, and pain medication; se was admitted to the hospital.

How LAI / exposure occurred: A pure culture of BCG was isolated from the LAI's infected lung; a tumor had also developed in the lung. The authors state that it could have "developed from a metastatic lesion following BCG vaccinations in 1944, 1949, and 1951 or have originated from an aerogenic infection during the production of BCG vaccine. It is not possible, on the basis of the information available, to determine which of these routes of infection is the most probable." The authors also speculate tthat the cancer may have increased susceptibiity to the BCG.

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure:

Follow-up procedures taken: Procedures were not changed, except to reinforce the rule of chest clinic visits every 3 months for all staff working in the BCG laboratory. The WHO requirements for a BCG lab were complied with: 1) the infected worker did not re-enter the laboratory 2)the rest of the staff were examined for possible tuberculosis infection 3) all cultures and current vaccine preparations were discarded.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: he horizontal laminar flow cabinet was considered acceptable due to the "low virulence of BCG" and the sterile air supply and constant operation of the cabinets." This article was published in 1077. Today, I assume that sealing vials of an infectious agent, including vaccine or attenuated strains, would be done with engineering controls that provided worker protection in addition to sterile products.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: The individual received medical attention, including hospitalization.

She was involved in isolating B. melitensis from the blood of a child who had eaten goat´s milk cheese from Mexico. She had not worked in a hood nor had she used gloves while handling the cultures. She recalled had fever, back pain, and chills at some time after working with Brucella, but this had been diagnosed as "flu". Case 3: Unknown The third case is only mentioned in a chart- no details are given.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Not worn (specifically stated in article)

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Case 1: He immediately washed his face and hands with disinfectant and lavaged his eyeds with sterile water. A brucella slide-agglutination test was positive at 1:320. Case 2: On admission she had a temperature of 104 F. Examination revealed uterine tenderness and vaginal bleeding. The hematocrit was 25% and the WBC count was 8,400/mm3. The prothrombin time was prolonged, and the titer of fibrin degradation products in her serum was 1:160. Without the history of exposure to Brucella, a diagnosis of premature rupture of fetal membranes and chorioamnionitis was made. Case 3: Unknown

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended the most stringent conditions for containment and requires that safety cabinets equipped with absolute filters be used for this manipulation.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Case 1: Without doing blood cultures, treatment was immediately begun with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (one double-strength tablet every 12 hr) with no improvement after one week. At that time, a two-week course of oral doxycycline (100 mg every 8 hr) plus im streptomycin (1 g daily) was prescribed). Within 12 hr of the first dose, he noted fever and severe generalized myalgias and arthralgias, but the following day he was markedly improved. After one week of treatment, he felt well and voluntarily discontinued treatment. Five days later the symptoms recurred with sacroiliac and shoulder pains being as severe as before. Tetracycline and streptomycin were reinstituted with prompt symptomatic relief. Case 2: After she was diagnosed as flu, she was treated with ampicillin. Treatment with IV clindamycin plus gentamicin was begun, and evacuation of the uterus was facilitated with pitocin. Shortly thereafter, a 220-g fetus was aborted and tissues rom both sides of the placenta were obtained for culture. Both the fetus and the placenta appeared normal; unfortunately, histologic examination of the placenta was not performed. Case 3: Unknown

Device or equipment involved: Unknown

Procedure being performed: CIE and ELISA antigen detection tests

How LAI / exposure occurred: A 26-year-old bacteriology technologist was in good health until five days before admission, when a sore throat and mild cervical lymphadenopathy developed. Three days before admission, she reported to work but left early because of increased cervical lymphadenopathy, fever, sweats, hedache, and dizziness. The origin of the patient´s infection is not known. In her work in the microbiology laboratory, she performed CIE and ELISA antigen detection tests for bacteria and viruses on various specimens, including serum, sputum, throat swabs, body fluids, and stool.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Gram´s stain of fluid from the right knee showed pleomorphic gram-negative organisms, while that of fluid from the right elbow and left wrist showed gram negative cocci and diplococci. Culture of fluid from the right knee yielded Salmonella enteritidis. Cultures of fluid form all other joints, collected after starting therapy, were negative. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of fluid from the right elbow confirmed Neisseria meningitidis, group C. This organism was also isolated from the patient´s throat.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: A review of all cultures in the microbiology laboratory for the three months before the patient´s illness disclosed no instance of isolation of S. enteritidis, serotype heidelberg. Nevertheless, it seems possible that, while performing ELISA tests for enteric viruses, she was exposed to aerosols of the Salmonella in a sample sent for immunodetection of enteroviruses but not cultured for bacterial pathogens. Meningococcus type C ELISA work was in progress at the time the patient became ill. Subsequent to this experience, ELISA should be performed in a biological safety cabinet.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Because of the rapidly progressive, additive polyarthritis, tenosynovitis, rash, and fever, a presumptive diagnosis of neisserial arthritis-dermatitis syndrome was made and she was treated with penicillin G potassium, 2 million units intravenously (IV) every four hours. The gram-negative organisms fro mboth cultures were identified morphologically as S. enteritidis serotype heidelbeerg. Because this organisms was sensitive to ampicillin, therapy was changed to ampicillin sodium, 1.5 g IV every four hours. With this therapy, her right knee whowed prompt and steady improvement. She could walk by day 3, and all knee stifness resolved by day 4. Nevertheless, her other joints behaved in a strikingly different manner. They remained hot, erythematous, swollen, and painful. Because of increase swelling in the right elbow on day 2, arthrocentesis was performed. She was treated with ampicillin IV for eight full days, and switched to chloramphenicol, 750 mg orally every six hours, because a pruritic rash developed secondary to ampicillin. Chloramphenicol therapy was discontinued 16 days after discharge, for a total antibiotic treatment period of 30 days.

Procedure being performed: Manipulation of cultures

How LAI / exposure occurred: Case 3: A laboratory worker that recalled extended manipulation of cultures from patient B in October and November without following Brucella-specific protocols. Based on this exposure history, brucellosis was suspected. (Patient : A 62-y-old female had blood cultures done at hospital in January and March 2009 which were identified as Ochrobactrum anthropi (Gram-negative bacillus) by the hospital B laboratory. On 27 October 2009, she had hip replacement surgery; purulent exudate from the hip was submitted for culture, and the organisms were initially identified as Corynebacterium-like bacteria. After further manipulations, a Brucella sp. was identified and reported to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) on November 4. It was determined that the previous blood cultures were misidentified Brucella spp.; all cultures were destroyed. Patient B was lost to follow-up, and the source of infection was unidentified. Case 4: One of the workers of the laboratory had an elevated Brucella antibody titer of 1:640 on 11 June 2010. This case had developed extreme fatigue, chills, fever, and arthralgia on 15 March bud did not seek treatment.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Based on the patient history, blood culture specimens were collected and submitted to the KHEL and laboratory D on June 3. Laboratory D was not notified that bucellosis was suspected. On June 7, KHEL identified the culture from the patient as Brucella suis and immediately notified KDHE and laboratory D. Laboratory D conducted a risk assessment in June 2010 of the laboratory and surgical staff that had been potentially exposed in January, March, or October 2009. All 19 hospital B laboratory workers were classified with high-risk exposures. Four surgical staff were classified with low-risk exposures despite the potential aerosolization of the culture positive purulent exudate when bone saw as used during the surgical procedure.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Due to these laboratory cases the CDC recommendations were reviewed and the accompanying literature was conducted to identify strategies to further prevent. These strategies were the risk classification, antimicrobial postexposure prophylaxis, serologic monitoring and symptom surveillance.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Case 3: PEP was not offered because the exposure was recognized more than 24 weeks after the las known exposure. Case 4: She received azithromycin (which has activity against Brucella spp.) in May for a sinus infection and symptoms abated. On June 18, case 4 began 6 weeks of doxycycline and rifampin. She had a reaction to rifampin 3 days later, and it was replaced with 2 weeks of gentamincin. She had a blood culture drawn on June 25 which yielded no Brucella growth.

How LAI / exposure occurred: Spill of approximately 1-1.5 liters of liquid from the fermentation apparatus (the liquid contained 2 x 1010 to 5 x 1010 CFU per milliliter of Salmonella enteritidis Phage type 8). Worker discovered spill and cleaned up using a mop, 5% bleach and a commercial disinfectant effective against SE. The mop was autoclaved before disposal in room A (a room 30ft away from the spill site). Upon analysis of workers in the production area, the strongest association with illness was among those working in room A. It should be noted that the PPE of the individual who cleaned up the spill is recorded but the PPE worn by other staff working in room A was not described

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Full body suit, Single pair of protective gloves, N95, Other PPE,

Procedure being performed: Manipulation of culture plates

How LAI / exposure occurred: A 44-year-old male (patient C) underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair a meniscal tear. He began to experience intermittent fever, headache, night sweats, malaise, myalgia, anorexia, knee pain, and inflammation in mid-May. On June 2, arthrocentesis was performed. The aspirate culture was preliminarily positive for Brucella spp. at hospital C. The Mississippi State Departement of Health (MSDH) Public Health Laboratory (PHL) confirmed the isolate as a Brucella sp. on 11 June, and CDC identified it as Brucella suis. Patient C had extensive contact with feral hogs; he was referred to an infectious disease physician for treatment. The culture plates were manipulated on an open bench at the hospital C laboratory. Three laboratory workers were identified with high-risk and 25 with low-risk exposures. On October 18, 2010, an infection control practitioner at hospital C notified MSDH that a laboratory worker with a high-risk exposure (case 5) reported intermittent fever, malaise, and shoulder and back pain for 3 weeks.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Blood and serum were collected from case 5 on October 18; B. suis was isolated, and BMAT titers were elevated. The isolates from patient C and case 5 matched according to the multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA) method.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Due to these laboratory cases the CDC recommendations were reviewed and the accompanying literature was conducted to identify strategies to further prevent. These strategies were the risk classification, antimicrobial postexposure prophylaxis, serologic monitoring and symptom surveillance. In addition hospital C instituted policy changes and provided additional education to staff and external partners. Hospital C personnel will manipulate all cultures under a BSC, and specimens will be labeled to alert personnel suspicious infectious agents.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Once that laboratory staff were identified, MSDH recommended PEP with doxycycline and rifampin for all exposed staff; one accepted PEP but stopped after 2 weeks due to side effects. Sixteen potentially exposed laboratory workers initiated serological monitoring, but only seven participated for 24 weeks. All were assessed weekly for symptoms. Case 5 had declined PEP but had provided sera for a Brucella microagglutination test (BMAT) at 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks postexposure (all were negative). Case 5 completed 6 weeks of doxycycline and rifampin.

How LAI / exposure occurred: The accidental per-cutaneous puncture through a nitrile glove and events post puncture are well described. No injection occurred following the puncture. The materials and wound were immediately decontaminated and post exposure notification of medical personnel was initiated. LCMV has no post exposure recommendations for prophylaxis other than patient monitoring which occurred regularly for up to 68 days following the incident.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Single pair of protective gloves, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Close observation was recommended with regular followup at the outpatient occupational health clinic.Eleven days after exposure, the injured worker developed a flu-like syndrome.Paracetamol was administered with improvement of the symptoms after a few days. Sixteen days after exposure, he reported chest pain exacerbated by lying down and dyspnoea, Laboratory studies showed normal cardiac enzymes, white blood count and brain natriuretic peptide. C-reactive protein was slightly elevated at 33mg/l. The chest radiograph and ECG were unremarkable.A  transthoracic echo-cardiogram showed no evidence of pericardial effusion, but slightly decreased left ventricular function (50–55%) was noted. With symptomatic treatment, chest pain resolved and dyspnoea improved. Twenty-seven days after exposure, the patient reported sudden onset of visual impairment. Homonymous left lower quadranopsia was noted on examination . The patient was hospitalized. An MRI scan of the brain was unremarkable. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies revealed a markedly elevated protein level (115mg/dl), elevated white blood count (460 cells/mm3) with 83%lymphocytes and a normal blood/CSF glucose ratio. LCMV PCR was negative in the CSF and plasma on Day 27 after exposure. The diagnosis of acute LCMV infection with meningoencephalitis was made on the basis of clinical presentation, incubation period and ELISA, revealing an increase in specific IgG LCMV antibodies after exposure (titre <1:100 on Day 0, 1:6400 on Day 19 and 1:25600 on Day 27). Concern over possible neurological sequelae led to the administration of ribavirin for a total of 10 days. Complete resolution of visual impairment was noted after 48h of treatment and confirmed on Day 68 after exposure.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: It was noted that the stock tube was maintained in one hand while the syringe was in the other. Though not detailed, the injury was categorized as a needle re-capping injury. Procedures relative to re-capping were not followed by the subject but were reviewed with the subject and the other workers following the injury. Placing tubes or containers in secure holders when returning or transferring infectious materials rather than holding the tube would have prevented the accidental injection of the subject's finger. In cases where it is not possible to place the tube into a secure holder or where an animal must be injected, protecting the non syringe hand with Kevlar TM or other penetration resistant gloves is highly recommended.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Ribavirin was used off protocol. The efficiency/efficacy of ribavarin post-exposure prophylaxis and treatment of LCMV has not been established. One other detail of note is that a positive LCMV PCR test was never observed. This may have been due to the fact that PCR tests were not conducted before Day 16 Antibody titers against LCMV antigen were conducted on Day 0 and Day 19 which confirmed a rising response to LCMV.

How LAI / exposure occurred: A 25-y-old laboratory worker (patient A) in a department of microbiology was referred to the infectious disease unit of St Pierre Hospital, Brussels. For 6 weeks he had had a headache and non-productive cough with lethargy, myalgias, anorexia, weight loss of 5 kg, drenching sweat, and nocturnal temperature spikes to 40,5 °C. After a rose-bengal plate test carried out immediately was strongly positive and the questionaire the patient revealed that he had been manipulating a B melitensis biotype 3 strain during May. On October 10, the man´s finacée (patient a 21-year-old unemployed woman, started complaining of headache, myalgias, anorexia weith weight loss of 2,5 kg and fever.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: The patient became afebrile after 36 h of treatment. The three blood cultures taken on the first day of treatment were positive 4 days later for B melitensis biotype 3. Further blood cultures (Aug 24, Sept 6, Sept 30) were negative.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The authors conclude that the ingestion or inhalation of infectious aerosol were responsible for the laboratory-acquired brucellosis in patient A. This is a recognised potential hazard in microbiology laboratories, and is mainly associated with the more invasive B melitensis species. A laboratory accident did not occur. The patient B probably became infected through person-to-person transfer. She had no history of brucellosis and there is no epidemiological evidence of any other route of transmission. Contaminated clothing can be ruled out: the laboratory woker wore a knee-length white coat and worked at a table of hip height, leaving no room for contamination of his ordinary clothing. One possibility is sexual transmission, although proof of this is lacking. Patients A and B had no sexual contact from the end of June until the beginning of September, because the the man felt so ill. After that they had sexual intercourse regularly. Patient A had slight haematuria when the disease becan but cultures of his urine and sperm, at the beginning of October were negative.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Patient A was treated with doxycycline 200 mg daily. Doxycycline was stopped on Sept. 9 after 3 weeks of treatment. The patient recovered completely, apart from persistent microscopic haematuria. Patient B. Doxycycline 200 mg daily for the fever. By Oct. 28, when she consulted the infectious disease unit, she was afebrile and her symptoms had disappeared. She had a discrete hepatomegaly. Significant laboratory results were limited to an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 40 mm/h and leucocyte count of 3700/mcL with 45% lymphocytes. A rose-bengal plate test was done immediately and was trongly positive. Three blood cultures set up on Oct 28 (7 days after doxycycline had been started) were negative, as was blood culture set up on Nov 26. However, the diagnosis of brucellosis was confirmed by significant serological tests, and doxycicline treatment was continued until Nov 29.

Samples were cultured on bioMérieux polyvitex chocolate agar in 10% carbon dioxide. On Dec 24, colonies of small gram-negative, catalase-positive and oxidase-positive coccobacilli had grown. Bacterial identirication strips identified Brucella melitensis biovar 3. Three people who wad been in contact with the samples were tested. Case 1: handled the samples from Dec 21. She opened the vial containing the aerobic blood culture, and smelt the first cultures on Dec 24. Serodiagnosis with Rose bengal was negative on Jan 9 and Jan 22. On Feb 24 she developed undulant fever. Serum agglutination was positive on Feb 29 and blood cultures grew a strain of B melitensis biovar 3 of the same type as the index case. Case 2: handled and smelt the cultures from Jan 2. The Rose bengal test was negative on Jan 9, Feb 21, and Mar 20 but positive on April 5. Symptoms were limited to mild fatigue. Blood cultures were negative. Case 3: handled and smelt cultures rom Jan 2 and did bacterial identification strips. Serum tests on Jan 8, Jan 22, Feb 21, and March 20 were negative. On April 5 the test was positive. Symptoms were night sweats only. Blood cultures remained sterile.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Laboratory identification.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: This laboratory epidemic confirms the profesisonal risk involved in sniffin cultures, a habit common in French laboratories to guide bacterial identification. Delays in seroconversion for two patients indicate that serum surveillance must be for at least 3 months. The index case is atypical, which shows the systematic precautions must be taken whatever the origin of the samples.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Case 1 and 2 were treated with 200 mg doxycycline daily for 6 weeks with intra-muscular netromycin (150 mg/day) for 2 weeks. Case 3 was treated with trimethoprim 160 mg-sulfamethoxazole 800 mg tablets twice daily for 10 days because of ther pregnancy. Therapeutic abortion was done after 9 days of treatment because of the risk of vertical transmission. Treatment with rifampicin 600 mg/day and doxycycline 200 mg/day was started. Symptoms disappeared after 4 weeks. Placental cultures were negative.

Procedure being performed: Removing stopper of Vacutainer tube by hand

How LAI / exposure occurred: The technician was removing the Vacutainer stopper by hand ("not using the tool provided") and felt a serum droplet in his left eye. "He reacted by blinking rapidly" and did not use the eyewash, although he had been trained twice, in the previous six months, to rinse the eye immediately in the event of an exposure. The technician had mild conjunctivitis from wearing contact lenses, which the authors state may have been a contributing factor.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Single pair of protective gloves,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure:

Follow-up procedures taken: No follow up procedures were taken, since the technician did not report the exposure until 5 weeks later, when his blood test indicated seroconversion to HIV. There was only 1 HIV-infected patient in the hospital where the technician worked. Nucleic acid sequence analysis of HIV1-E of the patient and the technician matched, indicating that the technician had a laboratory acquired infection.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The authors recommend wearing eye protection.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: None.

Device or equipment involved: Unknown

Procedure being performed: Laboratory preparedness proeficiency tests

How LAI / exposure occurred: In November 2007, New York State Department of Health notified CDC of potential exposures to attenuated vaccine strain Brucella abortus RB51 in multiple clinical laboratories that participated in a Laboratory Preparedness Survey (LPS) proeficiency test. This report summarizes the results of investigations in 36 states, two cities, one country and the District of Columbia. As of January 14, 2008, follow-up by public health officials with LPS-participating laboratories throughout the United States identified a total of 916 laboratory workers in 254 laboratories with potential exposure to RB51 strain (679) 74% with high-risk exposures and (237) 26% with low risk exposures.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Biological safety cabinet, Other engineering control,

Follow-up procedures taken: CDC subsecuently recommended that public health official conduct a review of biosafety practices at all LPS-participating laboratories to identifiy any additional RB51 exposures. To assess the magnitude of this even at the national level, on December 11, CDC requested information from state health departments regarding the number of LPS-participating laboratories in which exposures occurred, the number of persons categorized with high- and low-risk exposurres, and the number of persons recommended to receive PEP. States also were asked whether any illnesses that occurred in potentially exposed persons were consistent with brucellosis syptoms.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The results highlight the need for routine adherence to recommended biosafety practices when working with infectious organisms, particlularly during widespread infectious-disease events, including bioterrorism attacks. The numerous exposures identified during this LPS highlights the importance of adhering to biosafety practices when handling samples during proficiency testing and when handling specimens routinely entering clinical laboratories for identification. Biosafety practices minimize the risk of exposure; however inadvertent exposures still can occur when infectious agents enter the laboratory. All clinical laboratories that handle and test unknown specimens should establish and adhere to written diagnostic test protocols. These protocols should be incorporated directly into routine bench procedures and should indicate laboratory findings that signal the need for increased biosafety precautions. One lesson learned from this event is the potential vulnerability of laboratorians during large-scale events involving highly lethal infectious agents, even when the agent is recognized. In addition laboratory readiness should include annual review of biosafety protocols with particular attention to training laboratorians in the characteristics of particular agents and the biosafety practices recommended for their handling and testing.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) was recommended only for persons identified as having high-risk exposures but also was offered to those categorized as having low-risk exposures.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Academic institution

Device or equipment involved: Unknown

Procedure being performed: Unkown

How LAI / exposure occurred: Unvaccinated male in his early 20s was exposed to a VACV strain that had contaminated the seed stock with which the laboratory worked. Diagnosis of vaccinia infection took some time in part because of an inconsistency regarding the patient's recall of when he last worked with VACV.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Specimens from the patient were analysed by Virginia's Laboratory Response network. Molecular typing showed that the VACV that infected the worker was a different strain to that with which the laboratory normally worked. CDC analysed virus samples from the lab and detected a contaminant in the seed stock. Subsequent occupational health investigation revealed that although the occupational health clinic provided annual education on workplace safety (and appeared to offer smallpox vaccination to all lab workers who handled nonhighly attenuated VACV strains) the patient did not plan on taking the vaccination. Importantly, at the time, the institution only offered VACV counseling and vaccination to personnel who specifically requested vaccination, even if the employee's written work profile indicated VACV use.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: After the incident, changes in lab procedures regarding VACV-use was instituted: Counseling and education is offered to all personnel with occupational exposure to VACV. Vaccination is then offered to lab workers without medical contraindications, and a declination form is completed for those who decline the vaccine.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Prior to diagnosis of vaccinia infection: Prednisone (for swelling of right earlobe - 1 day) & cephalexin (for presumed bacterial infection - 1 day). Bacitracin (for the eye - 1 day). IV vancomycin, ceftriaxone (discontinued the same day), and pain medications. Piperacillin/tazobactam and clindamycin (at least 2 days; suspension of treatment is not specified). After vaccinia infection suspected: 800 mg acyclovir IV (duration not stated)

Procedure being performed: Blood collection from an anesthetized SIV-infected macaque, serology testing on SIV-infected samples

How LAI / exposure occurred: Case 1: The worker suffered a needle stick incident while attempting to disconnect the vacutainer holder from the needle after obtaining blood from an anesthetized SIV-infected macaque. The needle, visibly contaminated with blood, penetrated a latex glove and produced a deep puncture wound that caused the thumb to bleed. Case 2: The worker had no history of percutaneous or mucous membrane exposure to SIV. However, the worker had severe dermatitis involving the forearms and hands and performed serology on clinical specimens from SIV-infected monkeys without gloves.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Lab coat, Single pair of protective gloves,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Biological safety cabinet,

Follow-up procedures taken: Case 1: The worker immediately scrubbed the wound with a povidone-iodine solution and then with a 10% bleach solution. Case 2: Serum samples from the laboratory worker, pre and post-exposure, were tested.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: In both cases, departures from recommended safety procedures occurred. Case 1: The vacutainer holder should be disconnected after disposal of the contaminated needle. Case 2: The work on clinical specimens should be conducted with gloves.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Case 1: The worker was treated with oral dicloxacillin and warm compresses. Case 2: Unknown. Neither of the two workers have shown clinical or laboratory evidence of immunodeficiency.

Procedure being performed: Clinical specimens handling/isolation

How LAI / exposure occurred: Cases no. 1 and no. 2 relate to index case I, whereas cases no. 3, 4, and 5 are linked to index case II. Index case I: In june 1990, a 29-y-old spaniard was referred to the Kantonsspital of St. Gall because of polyarthritis. He had lived at his brother´s farm in Spain 3 months previously where he had consumed goat products. Index case II: An 18-month-old girl from the ex-Yugoslavia (Kosovo) presented with gonarhritis and fever in November, 1991. the purulent puncture material grew B. melitensis. The diagnosis was confirmed by a reference laboratory where identification of the isolate was done simultaneously. All six working staff members of the Infectious Disease Laboratory in the University Children´s Hospital were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and by complement fixation for antibodies to Brucella and tested negative. Case 1: A 28-y-old laboratory technician presented at the biginning of February, 1991, with signs of bilateral sacroileitis wich regressed only transiently upon antirheumatic therapy. Two months later, she was subfebrile and was hospitalized fro further evaluation. She recalled having worked with strains of Brucella (isolated from index case I) in June and October the year before. Case 2: In late March, 1991, a 34-y-old female technician manifested with a flu-like illness lasting for 2 weeks. Two months later, when brucellosis was diagnosed in her colleague (case no. 1). Case 3: A 55-y-old staff member presented two months after having worked with the strain (from index case II), later identified as Brucella, with spiking fever up to 40°C and arthralgia. In two out of three blood cultures B. melitensis was detected. Case 4: A 44-y-old technician presented 4 months after having worked with the strain (from index case II) subsequently identified as Brucella with fever, myalgia, arthralgia, and severe headache. Case 5: A 27-y-old technician developed fever and arthralgia wich resolved within one week and was interpreted as viral influenza. Four months earlier, she had worked with a hitherto unidentified strain (isolated from index patient II) and sent to this laboratory as a reference culturer.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Case 1: A Brucella microagglutination antibody test was positive at a titer of 1:160. Two of three blood cultures a puncture material from the sacroiliacal joint grew B. melitensis. Case 2: When brucellosis was diagnosed in her colleague (case no. 1) all staff members of the laboratory were tested for antibody titers to Brucella, her agglutination titer was positive at 1:160. In October, the Brucella agglutinin titer was 1:80, and in December, it had dropped to <1:40. She delivered a healthy child. Case 3: Two months later after the treatment she presented again because of a 2 x 2 cm fluctuating abscess at the border of the mamary areola. A puncture revealed a small quantity of pus, and the biopsy a chronic granulomatous inflammation. One blood culture and the puncture material grew B. melitensis. The abscess was drained and again treated with antimicrobial therapy. Case 4: In three of three blood cultures B. melitensis was detected and oral therapy was initiated. After the initial treatment a half weeks later, she experienced abdominal and left-sided thoracic pain. Despite the absence of radiological or ultrasonographic signs of pleurisy, spondylitis, and intra-abdominal abscesses, and despite negative blood cultures, a relapse of Brucella infection was suspected and therapy was switched. Case 5: Two months later, she noticed swelling and tenderness of her left foot, and after 2 more weeks she developed a 3 x 3 cm subcutaneous tumor over her left tibia wich was diagnosed as erythema nodosum by a rheumatologist. Cultures of pus and two out of three blood cultures grew B. melitensis. A fistulous osteomyelitis was excluded through conventional X-ray examination.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Serological surveys and instructions of laboratory workers regarding the clinical diversity of the disease are helpful for early recognition of secondary cases. On the other hand, clinicians should consider brucellosis in medical laboratory workers with unexplained signs and symptoms. All the isolates were identified to the genus level according to standard laboratory methods but the isolates of the index cases were handled without any specific safety precautions such as work under a safety hood, wearing of gloves, masks, and protective glasses. Knowledge about the high risk of Brucella infection in laboratory personnel is important for clinicians not only in order to suspect brucellosis in these individuals but also in order to help revent secondary cases. WHO has classifiedd brucellosis as a risk group III pathogen for laboratory personnel, indicating a high risk. Aerosol transmission is widely accepted as the potential biohazard for brucellosis in laboratories and the most stringent conditions for containment and the use of safety cabinets have been recommended for the processing of material potentially containing Brucella. Although bacteriology laboratories may be equipped with laminar flow cabinets, routine manipulation of specimens for isolation of bacterial pathogens will not be done under the most stringent precautions because of practical reasons.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Case 1: Oral doxycycline (200 mg/day) and rifampin (900 mg/day) had been given for 6 weeks. Case 2: Because of pregnancy (7th week), she was given intravenous ceftriaxone (2g/day) during the first trimenon. Two of two blood cultures grew B. melitensis and treatment was switched to oral TMP-SMX (320 mg + 1600 mg/day) and rifampin (600 mg/day) for an additional 6 weeks. Case 3: Oral TMP-SMX (320 mg + 1600 mg/day) for 6 weeks. On the second stage of the treatment she was given ciprofloxacin (1500 mg/day) and doxycycline (200 mg/day) were started fro 6 weeks. She suffered no more relapses. Case 4: Oral TMP-SMX (320 mg + 1600 mg/day). Therapy was switched to doxycycline (200 mg/day) and rifampin (900 mg/day) for 6 weeks. No recurrence of symptoms was noted. Case 5: Rheumatologist prescribed non-steroidal antirheumatics fro 2 weeks. The lesion developed into an abscess and was incised. The patient was given doxycycline (200 mg/day) and rifampin (900 mg/day) for 6 weeks. Since then, she has been asymptomatic.

Procedure being performed: Working with vaccinia virus

How LAI / exposure occurred: A 25-year-old research technician who had not been previously vaccinated was working with vaccinia virus and accidentally cut her left second finger on a cover slip. Twelve days later a lesion, which she described as a pimple developed at the site of the cut. She squeezed the pimple and a drop of pus squirted onto her face. Over the next several days both lesions grew progressively worse; auxiliary and submental adenopathy were first noted at day 14, and she developed generalized malaise and fever to 102,9 at day 17. Infection likely occurred through contamination of the finger laceration and was probably tarnsferred secondarily to the chin through autoinoculation.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Five days of the initial appearance of the finger blister, an aspirate of the blister was taken for bacterial, fungal and viral cultures. Bacterial and fungal cultures were negative. The aspirate was inoculated onto monolayers of primary rhesus monkey kidney (PRMK) and MRC-5 cell cultures. A cytopathic effect (CPE) was seen in PRMK and MRC-5 cultures at 2 and 3 days, respectively, after inoculation. The CPE was extensive and was not typical or recognizable of viral agents commonly isolated. Immunofluorescent tests performed on infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus were negative. negative-stain electron microscopy performed on culture fluids from infected cell cultures was negative. Subsequently, infected cell cultures were centrifuged, the cell pellet fixed in glutaraldehyde and embedded in Epon 812; the resulting block as sectioned and counterstained. Particles with typical poxvirus morphology were readily observed. Neutralizing antibody to vaccinia was not detectable in serum obtained from the patient 2 weeks after infection but was detected 25 days after infection.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Exposure to vaccinia virus should raise the index of suspicion for patients with skin lesions. rapid diagnosis may be accomplished by direct examination of lesion material by electron microscopy. Enfrocement and monitoring of safety measures utilized in the laboratory is essential. Following this incident, procedures for handling contaminated glassware were reviewed and changed to prevent a repetition of this incident. Employees should also be educated about the potential hazards of their work environment, including autoinoculation and the potential spread to contacts.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: the patient was initially treated empirically with trimethoprim/sufamethoxazole and then cephalexin. Vaccinia immune globulin, ribavirin and cidofovir were not given.

How LAI / exposure occurred: Case 1: A 28-year-old female patient was working on a research project with S. schenckii, identifying glycoproteins in the cell wall. The patient had a pregnancy period of 25 weeks. one month before her check-up tests she started with a dermatosis located on the upper third of the right thigh, initially it was an erythematous lesion that grew progressively to form an indurated nodule of 3 cm in diameter, with a superficial ulcer in the center, without secretion and asymptomatic. The patient denied the history of any cutaneous trauma or inadequate management of the culture media. Case 2: A 35-year-old female patient was working on a research project when accidentally broke a vial with strains of S. chenckii, which caused a cutting wound in the right hand. Three weeks later the patient developed a nodule in the center of the palm of her hand.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Case 1: A sample from the lesion was taken and added to a Sabouraud agar. The results of the histopathological study, epidermal hyperplasia and chronic acute inflammatory infiltrate were observed as well as the existence of an asteroid body in the center of an accumulation of neutrophils. Case 2: A sample of the secretion was cultured in agar medium of Sabouraud. A membranous colony was developed with areas of black pigmentation.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The frequency and number of fungal agents that can potentially cause disease in laboratory personnel are very low. Only a few species are capable of producing the disease in immunocompetent people. The dimorphic fungi Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum and Blastomyces dermatitidis are responsible for most fungal laboratory infections. Acquiring a mycosis in the laboratory, involves considering the possible risk routes. The most usual variable is the management of cultures with the agent. On the other hand, transportation and processing of biopsy specimens or tissues obtained postmortem and body fluids; In all cases it is necessary to consider traumatisms or abrasions that could be important for the inoculation (needles, scalpels, rupture of culture media or containers that contain the pathogenic agent, skin abrasions).

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Case 1: Because of pregnancy, an observational study was carried out and the lession remained without progression. By the end of her pregnancy and after 3 months of lactation, potassium iodide was prescribed and the patient received treatment for two weeks in a irregular manner. She was prescribed itraconazole (200 mg/daily for three months with clinical improvement). The patient opted for the surgical removal of the residual lesion without performing histopathological study. Case 2: Potassium iodide was prescribed, which the patient did not tolerate and then an alternative treatment (terbinafine, 250 mg/daily for two months) was implemented with very good response.

How LAI / exposure occurred: Case 1: Patient reported working at an Indiana rodent breeding facility (facility A). Case 2: Aseptic meningitis had been diagnosed in patient 2, who was patient 1´s domestic partner and co-worker. After investigation, job duties of employees at facilities (A-C) ranged from administrative/managerial duties to direct handling of live and euthanized rodents to cleaning. Most employees conducted multiple duties in multiple buildings. No particular job duty was associated with LCMV infection. employees had worked at the facilities fro 2 days-20 years, and 1 case-patient had worked at facility A for only 5 days before becoming ill. The authors found no association between length of time employed and previous infection, suggestingrelatively recent LCMV introduction into the facilities. For facility A, working in building 2 and smoking were independently associated with having recent or previous LCMV infection. For facilities B and C, no specific factors evaluated were associated with LCMV infection in employees tested. At the time of the investigation, all 97 employees reported washing hands after handling the rodents, and 90-100% of employees reported wearing masks and gloves, although many admitted having begun using these items only when the LCMV outbreak was suspected.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure:

Follow-up procedures taken: LCMV infection was suspected in both patients and specimens were submitted to CDC for diagnostic confirmation. Serum samples from patients 1 and 2 and CSF from patient 1 were positive for LCMV IgM by ELISA, indicating recent LCMV infection. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) for LCMV was negative, indicating that viremia was no longer present. The County Health Department, in conjunction with the Indiana State Department of Health, Indiana Board of Animal Health, and CDC, initiated an outbreak investigation to determine the extent of LCMV in the staff and rodents facility A. Trace-back investigations also identified a distributor (facility where live rats (Rattus norvegicus) and mice (M. musculus) from facility A were handled and packaged for sale as live and frozen animal food in 21 states. An additional mouse breeding facility in Kentuky (facility C) had shipped live mice to facility B, which redistributed them to facility A shortly before the outbreak. As part of the investigation, an employee serosurvey was carried out from all the facilities (A, B and C) within the previous 6 months the opportunity to be interviewed and tested for LCMV as part of the investigation. County health officials administred a questionnaire that collected information about recent clinical illness and work habits at the facilities, including hygiene measures. A blood sample was collected from each interviewee and refrigerated for transport to CDC, where IgG and IgM ELISA were performed. Adult breeding rodents (mice and rats) from facility A were sampled to determine LCMV infection status for each room. In accordance with the facility´s standard operating procedurs for processing feeder rodents, we euthanized mice and rats with carbon dioxide gas, and the carcasses were frozen and shipped to CDC on dry ice. Carcasses were thawed, and animals were dissected under Biosafety Level 3 conditions. heart blood and small sections of kidney and spleen were collected. Rodents specimens were tested fro LCMV RNA by RT-PCR and for LCMV IgG by ELISA. RT-PCR-positive specimens were inoculated onto cell culture to isolate virus, and viral RNA was sequenced and compared with other LCMV strains.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Employees of rodent breeding facilities of all kinds should be aware of the risks posed by exposure to rodents infected with LCMV, and monitoring programs should be in place to detect and control infections in rodents. Comercial laboratory rodent breeding colonies have developed management practices to avoid contact between wild mice and colony animals; the US Department of Health and human Services and the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations recommended doutine virologic and serologic monitoring to detect pathogens, including LCMV. Facilities producing rodents for the pet and the feeder-rodent industries should adapt these practices to avoid such outbreaks. When LCMV or LCMV antibodies are detected in rodents or emplyees ofr a rodent breeding operation, all animal-handling personnel should wear protective equipment, including a respirator. After personal protective gear and training in its proper use were provided to facility employees, LCMV infection was not laboratory confirmed in any additional employees of facility A throughout the depopulation process, which implies that use of such equipment can reduce the risk for infection. Laboratory and epidemiologic investigations effectively identified a large outbreak of LCMV in 3 commercial mouse breeding facilities and associated infections in several employees. The presumptive source of virus introduction was contact between wild mice and colony mice, and the outbreak spread among facilities when mice were transported for use as breeding stock. The breeding colonies were depopulated to prevent further human infections. Future outbreaks can be prevented with strict biosecurity and microbiological monitoring, and employees should be made aware of the symptoms of LCMV infection and prevention measures.

How LAI / exposure occurred: On December 19, 2016, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene collected a respiratory specimen from a veterinarian experiencing influenza-like illness after exposure to sick domestic cats at an animal shelter in New York, NY, USA.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: The specimen tested positive for influenza A but could not be subtyped. Specimen aliquots were shipped to the Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health, and to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Next-generation sequencing performed at the New York State Department of Health generated a partial genomic sequence of (6 to 8 influenza A virus gene segments) that aligned most closely with North American lineage LPAI A (H7N2) viruses. North American linage H7 real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) testing and diagnostic sequence analysis performed at CDC confirmed the sample to be positive for influenza A (H7N2) virus. Virus isolation was attempted by inoculating the sample in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs and MDCK CCL-34 and CRFK cell lines. A /New York/108/2016 was successfully isolated from eggs but not from MDCK or CRFK cells. Codon complete sequencing of the egg-isolated virus showed no nucleotide changes compared with the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) gene segments sequenced directly from the clinical specimen. The virus was nearly identical (99.9%) to a virus isolated from a cat, A/feline/New York/16-040082-1/2016, from a New York shelter where the veterinarian had worked; the cat died of its illness.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The circulation of an influenza A (H7N2) virus at the animal-human interface, specially among common companion animals such as domestic cats, is of public health concern. Moreover, from an epidemiologic perspective, it is essential to understand the current distribution of LPAI A (H7N2) viruses in both avian and feline hosts. The US Department of Agriculture and state departments of agriculture have conducted routine avian influenza surveillance in live bird markets; 132,000-212,000 tests for avian influenza were performed annually during 2007-2014, but LPAI A (H7N2) were not detected.

How LAI / exposure occurred: unknown- this report describes an anonymous serosurvey of personnel working with non-human primates, to evaluate how many people may have become infected to spumaviruses. In 1993, CDC started a voluntary testing and counseling program for occupational exposure to SIV. In 1995, surveillance included SFV, STLV, and simian type D retroviruses. This report states that, as of November 26, 1996, 231 samples were tested and 3 were positive for SFV. Worker 1 worked with non-human primates (NHPs)for 20 years, and was bitten twice in the late 60s and early 70s. Stitches were required to close the bites. Worker 2 was a research scientist who worked with biological specimens from NHPs for 30 years; he had two puncture wounds in the early 1970s. Worker 3 was a veterinary technician who worked with NHPs for 30 years, he had multiple minor injuries, mucocutaneous exposures to NHP body fluids, and in approx. 1980, had a severe baboon bite.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Testing indicated persistent infection of all 3, with virus isolation from worker 1 and PCR identification of SFV in all 3. Sexual transmission did not occur with worker 2 and 3; barrier precautions were not used in their long-term monogamous relationships.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The article conclusion emphasizes measures for decreasing frequency of NHP exposures through training, education, universal precautions, work practices and engineering controls to reduce exposures to sharps[ PPE for bite prevention.

How LAI / exposure occurred: At least four individuals may been infected with SARS at the Institute. These include the two laboratory workers reported in April, and two additional laboratory workers. These two additional laboratory workers appear to have suffered from SARS-like illnesses in early February 2004. Recent laboratory tests performed at a national reference laboratory were positive for SARS antibodies. The use of inactivated SARS coronavirus, which was not tested to determine the effectiveness of the inactivation, in a general laboratory at the Institute appears the most cause of the outbreak.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: During the investigation, it became apparent that all the positive workers worked in the same general laboratory at the Institute. Although no research involving live SARS virus was known to have taken place in this laboratory, SARS coronavirus that had been inactivated in a BSL-3 laboratory in the Institute was used on several occasions during the early months of 2004 in experiments carried out in this area. The timing of the use of inactivated SARS coronavirus in the general laboratory coincides with the presence there of all the positive workers and with their likely incubation periods.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: WHO recommends that further work is needed to verify the effectiveness of the method used to inactivate the live SARS virus. At the same time, other possible explanations of the cause of the outbreak cannot be fully excluded. In addition WHO will be working with Member States and expert groups to develop country and regional strategies to strengthen biosafety and include: - A containment policy to reduce the number of laboratories storing and working on SARS coronavirus. - A legislative framework and independent advisory body to assist in the development, implementation and evaluation of a national biosafety programme and in the investigation of biohazard incidents and the dissemination of lessons learned to the global scientific community. - A laboratory accreditation system based on standardized biosafety criteria. - An occupational health service to monitor the well being of laboratory workers. - Comprehensive biosafety and training programmes in all diagnostic research institutes. - Researchers use appropriate and intenernationally accepted methods for validating the inactivation of live viruses. - Inactivated material should be handled only in laboratories at biosafety level 2 or above. - Researchers handling inactivated material should wear appropriate personal protective equipment. - New methods for inactivation should be adopted onlyafter rigorous testing. - Clear and comprehensive protocols should be available for all inactivation techniques.

How LAI / exposure occurred: Scrub typhus LAIs were documented in 25 individuals, from 1931-2000 with 8 (32%) deaths during the pre-antibiotic era (pre-1950s). In these reports, primary routes of infection were cutaneous (accidental self-inoculation and animal bites - 24%) and aerosols (16%), but another 60% were unstated. There were 35 murine typhus LAI reports and no deaths. The earliest recorded LAI was in 1931 when a technician in Japan sustained an accidental self-inoculation injury while inoculating a rabbit. The last reported scrub typhus was in 2001 and was caused by an aerosol exposure.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Results in this study indicated that highest risk activities were working with infectious laboratory animals involving significant aerosol exposures, accidental self-inoculation or bite related infections. A risk-based biosafety approach for in vitro and in vitro culture of O. tsutsugamushi and R. typhi would require only high-risk activities (animal work or large culture volumes) be performed in high containment BSL-3 laboratories. The authors argue that relatively low risk activities including inoculation of cell cultures or the early stages of in vitro growth using low volumes/low concentrations of infectious materials can be performed safety in BSL-2 laboratories withing a biological safety cabinet.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Results presented in this article clearly demonstrate that the highest risk activities for O. tsutsugamushi and R. Typhi LAIs relate to working with infectious laboratory animals where significant aerosol exposures or bite-related infections may occur. In 1951, Smadel highlighted the hazardous nature of rickettsial research in the following points: 1) ignorant, careless or indifferent worker; 2) poor laboratory practices; 3) poor architectural design of the laboratory or inadequate equipment; 4) certain pathogenic agents which are especially communicable in the laboratory and ; 5) unavoidable accidents. The authors believe that there is a need for a risk-based approach to biological safety regarding the culture O. tsutsugamushi and R. typhi and therefore suggest that the blanket risk classification of these organisms as RG3 coupled with BSL3 containment requirement for all infectious activities should be revisited. The reports presented in this article gave no evidence for scrub typhus or murine typhus infections in the community near but outside the laboratories caused by laboratory incidents or procedural errors. This observation confirms that reasonably close contact with the infectious source is required to cause infection and that the need for BSL3 laboratory containment is only required when performing high-risk procedures such as large-scale propagation or housing of infected animals.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Unknown Not described in this article. However Orentia spp. and Rickettsia spp. are susceptible to antibiotic therapy with doxycycline as first line treatment and azithromycin as an alternative treatment such as in the case of infections during pregnancy.

How LAI / exposure occurred: Between June and September 1988, four technicians from the microbiology laboratory of the Valme University Hospital, Seville, Spain were diagnosed with acute brucellosis. No evidence of exposure to Brucella spp. other than through the laboratory cultures was found for any patient. All four affected technicians had been working in the room where the blood cultures were handled. A biosafety hood was not used.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Direct microbiological diagnosis was reached by serial blood cultures, which were processed in the BACTEC NR-730 system by using one aerobic 6A bottle and one anaerobic 7A bottle. Samples were incubated for 30 days and were shaken during the first 48 h of incubation. Each bottle was tested twice on days 1 and 2 of incubation, once a day on days 3 to 7 of incubation, and twice weekly thereafter for the final 3 weeks of incubation. Indirect diagnosis was assessed by the Rose Bengal test, microagglutination, and the Coombs test for Brucella spp. One acute-phase serum specimen was obtained from all patients. The Rose Bengal test was positive for all patients.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Members from the Preventive Medicine Department of the hospital carried out an investigation of the possible causes of the outbreak. No laboratory accident was reported during the period of the outbreak as a result of handling either strains of Brucella spp. or the blood cultures in which they were isolated. The laboratory-acquired infections are not due to accidents in more than 80% of the cases. The probable source of infection may be apparent in many cases, but the form of transmission is often speculative. The inhalation of infective aerosols produced accidentally or unintentionally by numerous microbiological techniques is the most frequent cause of acquisition of infection in the laboratory. Microbiology laboratory infection hazards must be kept in mind by laboratory workers. consequently, the need for strict observation of the safety rules when handling infectious material must be emphasized, specially when handling strains of highly infective microorganisms like Brucella spp. All of those facts support the importance of the following universal recommendations: a) procedures known to produce aerosols should be minimized or should be conducted under a biosafety hood. b) handling of biosafety level 3 organisms, must be conducted under biosafety hoods and the plates should be sealed for safety when they are not in use.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Doxycycline (100 mg given orally twice daily for 6 weeks) and streptomycin (1.0 g given intramuscularly four times daily for 3 weeks) was given to all patients.

How LAI / exposure occurred: This article describes chronic brucellosis in an 8-y-old boy whose diagnosis was missed for several months; the diagnosis was made only after an epidemiologic investigation was undertaken concerning the development of burcellosis in two laboratory technologists at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin (CHW). The child was an 8-year-old boy Hispanic male who had developed severe peistaxis 6 months previously. A third laboratory worker at another hospital also developed evidence of brucellosis after exposure to one of the first two technologists blood samples. After careful reflection the index technologist recalled an isolate with which she had worked 5 months previously. This organism, a small Gram-negative coccobacillus, was originally isolated at an outside hospital from an 8-y-old boy with presumed idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Case 1: Based on positive blood and bone marrow cultures for Brucella melitensis biotype 6 and positive Brucella serology (1:5120), the diagnosis of brucellosis was made. Because of a lack of likely exposure to Brucella anywhere but in her work environment, an investigation was launched to determine the possible source of her infection. The serologic examination of 12 other workers revealed another technologist who, although asymptomatic, was found to have an anti-Brucella titer of 1:256. Concurrently a microbiology technologist at the hospital to which the index technologist had been admitted developed night sweats and was found to have an anti-Brucella titer of 1:80 with an anti-Brucella EIA IgM of 6.7 units. After 72 hours the laboratory at the outside hospital reported they had isolated a small Gram-negative coccus from both blood cultures. The isolates were eventually identified (using API-NFT at CHW) as M. phenylpyruvica.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The most important aspect of this case was the demonstration of the degree of which Brucella is a laboratory hazard. Brucella organisms are highly infectious if ingested or inhaled after aerosolization. Even contact of the microorganism with the conjuntiva may result in infection. Aerosolization can occur during a variety of common laboratory activities including subculturing from blood broth to solid media, staining for identification and dividing samples for multiple assays. Because Brucella is a class 3 organism, all work should take place in biosafety cabinets with appropriate air handling capacity. Unfortunately at times the presence of Brucella is not suspected because of unfamiliarity with the organism, the infrequency with which it is encountered and its unremarkable apperance

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: The 8-y-old boy received intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and his platelet count rose to a normal value. After had identified the organism, the patient was treated for 6 days with intravenously administered cefuroxime and then discharged. For the next 5 months he remained well with a normal platelet count, no fevers, night sweats or weight loss. After readmission the child was treated with intravenous trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) (10 mg/kg/day, TMP) and gentamycin (5 mg/kg/day) for 10 days. His blood cultures immediately became negative. At his discharge the aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferease had fallen to 135 and 384 IU/liter, respectively, and oral TMP/SMX was prescribed for him for another 4 weeks.

Procedure being performed: culture of fine-needle aspiration of patient with brucellosis

How LAI / exposure occurred: A fine-needle aspiration sample from a patient was cultured on the bench by a microbiology technician. The technician suspected Haemophilus species, and so, even though the bacteria was slow-growing, the initial tests were done on the open bench. When the isolate was confirmed as Brucella, the patient was seen in occupational health, but she declined post exposure prophylaxis. The authors cite publications indicating the high rate of LAI from aerosol exposure when microbiological tests are conducted on the open bench.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: This is a case study in NEJM because the lab technician sought medical attention 5 times over 12 days prior to hospital admission. The diagnosis was LAI with B. melitensis, with cervical spinal osteomyelitis and epidural abscess. Medical details of treatment are provided; resolution of symptoms was slow and antibiotic treatment continued for 3 months. After 18 months, she has some neck pain but is well.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: In the section "Lessons Learned by the Laboratory", the discussion listed: 1) retrain of lab staff to use Biosafety Level 3 practices (gloves, gown, avoidance of aerosols by use of a biosafety cabinet) for the initial workup of all positive blood cultures and slow growing organism resembling brucella. 2) physicians were reminded to put note, on culture requests, if Brucella is suspected. 3) Post-exposure prophylaxis is recommended. 4) There are some limitations in serological testing of those exposed.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Prophylactic antibiotics were offered after the exposure, but were refused. The symptoms developed 7 months later.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Clinical laboratory

Device or equipment involved: Unknown

Procedure being performed: Processed blood cultures

How LAI / exposure occurred: In May 2006 the laboratory technician had processed blood cultures of a patient with acute brucellosis admitted to the infectious diseases unit. The worker explained that, although she conducted both smear preparation and subculturing in a Clas II biosafety cabinet (BSC) wearing gloves, she may have been more exposed during plate reading and bacterial suspension for biochemical identification, wich were carried out on the open bench.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Single pair of protective gloves,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Biological safety cabinet,

Follow-up procedures taken: Use of rpoB sequencing and MLVA-16 typing to trace back the source infection. Blood cultures and serological screening were performed. Blood cultures were processed at 37°C using the BACTEC 9120 system. Subcultures were made on Columbia Blood Agar plates supplemented with 5% sheep blood. A presumpltive identification of B. melitensis was achieved using the VITEK 2 system. The Wright agglutination test was positive at a titre of 1/5120. A diagnosis of brucellosis was therefore made.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: A highly discriminatory typing system called MLVA-16 has been proposed for the analysis of genetic relatedness between strains. Moreover, the MLVA-16 fingerprint pattern of a Brucella strain proved to be stable by comparing both Brucella strains isolated from different patients within the same outbreak. These considerations coupled with the results of the tests conducted, led the authors to conclude that the laboratory technician acquired the infection in the laboratory. It is likely that exposure occurred outside the Class II BSC, either through the handling of open-plate cultures, or through the inhalation of material from the liquid or plate cultures belonging to the aforementioned hospitalised patient. Culturing, incubation, examination of plates for bacterial growth and performarnce of biochemical, serological and antibiotic susceptibility tests, may result in direct exposure of laboratory technicians and contamination of the laboratory environment. The inhalation of infectious aerosols produced during the employment of microbiological techniques is the most frequent cause of infection in the lab. It is prudent, therefore, to recommend the use of BSC. Moreover, all exposed personnel should be periodically tested for specific anti-Brucella antibodies.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: The patient was treated with streptomycin, rifampicin and doxycycline and was discharged at the end of August.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Research laboratory

Device or equipment involved: Syringes

Procedure being performed: Evaluation of immune response of mice to B. anthracis

How LAI / exposure occurred: On June 9, 2004, the California Department of Health Services was notified of possible inadvertent exposure to B. anthracis spores where workers were evaluating the immune response of mice to B. anthracis. No spills, puncture wounds, animal bites or scratches were identified; however initial handling of the suspension included snapping lids of microtubes, ejection of pipette tips, and centrifuging. Because staff members believed they were working with inactive organisms, they had performed these activities on an open bench, and appropriate PPE was not consistently used until after the deaths of the second group of mice.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Lab coat, Single pair of protective gloves,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Biological safety cabinet,

Follow-up procedures taken: On May 28, 2004 staff members injected 10 mice with a suspension believed to contain nonviable vegetative cells of B. anthracis Ames strain. The suspension was centrifuged and drawn into syringes on an open bench in the laboratory. The mice were injected in a separate animal-handling facility. By May 30, all of the injected animals had unexpectedly died. The carcassess were removed from the cages, placed into a plastic biohazard bag and frozen. The bedding was discarded as standard animal waste. The cages were sanitized in an automated washer. On June 4, an additional 40 mice were injected with the same suspension. By June 7, all but one of these mice had died. All subsequent work was performed under a biological safety cabinet (BSC), and additional personal protective equipment (PPE) was used (i.e., protective clothing and gloves). Animal cages were brought into the BSC, and the surviving animal was euthanized. The carcasses were removed, placed into double biohazard bags, and frozen. The bedding and cages were autoclaved. On June 8, a sample of the original suspension was cultured; one mouse that died after the second experiment was necropsied and samples for cultures were obtained from its liver and peritoneal cavity. Within 24 hours, these cultures grew nonhemolytic gram-positive rods. Colony morphology was consistent with B. anthracis. Suspension material and cultures were transported to California Laboratory Response Network (LRN) reference laboratory for further identification. The LRN lab confirmed that the isolated organism were B. anthracis by polimerase chain reaction and gamma phage lysis assay. A deep investigation was carried out by CDC. As part of routine laboratory procedure, horizontal surfaces had been cleaned with a buffered bleach solution (1:10 dilution) at the end of each day. After laboratory workers recognized the possibility of exposure to viable B. anthracis spores, all lab surfaces and hoods were cleaned twice more with the bleach solution. The animal facility was also sanitized with bleach and a quaternary ammonium disinfectant.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The findings underscore the importance of using appropriate biosafety practices and performing adequate sterility testing when working with material believed to contain inactivated B. anthracis organisms. B. anthracis spores are highly resistant to the effects of heat and chemical disinfection. Although the heat-killing procedures used by the contractor might have been lethal to vegetative cells, the procedures were not lethal to spores. Modifying suspension preparations by increasing the temperature and duration of heat-killing procedures or using formalin will increase the probability that spores are inactivated. BSL-2 procedures should be applied to all suspension manipulations performed before confirming sterility. After sterility is confirmed, lab personnel should continue to use BSL-2 procedures while performing activities with a high potential for expelling aerosolized spores. In addition, laboratories working with inactivated B. anthracis organisms should develop and implement training activities and incident-response protocols to ensure appropriate actions are taken in the event of a potential exposure. These protocols should describe mechanisms for offering counseling and postexposure chemoprophylaxis and obtaining paired sera from potentially exposed persons. Training at animal research facilities should emphasize prompt dead and any special handling procedures are needed for carcasses and bedding. Finally, institutional biosafety committees should routinely review protocols and procedures to ensure that appropriate safety precautions are always in place.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Twelve persons were involved in either the laboratory or its animal-handling facilities. Three of these persons had direct contact with the bacterial suspensions, cultures, or infected animals. All of them received postexposure chemoprophylaxis for prevention of inhalational anthrax (i.e., either ciprofloxacin 500 mg or doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 60 days). All 12 were additionally offered, but declined, anthrax vaccine under an Investigational New Drug (IND) protocol for postexposure prophylaxis. Eight of the 12 potentially exposed persons opted to take chemoprophylaxis, including the three persons for whom the regimen was recommended. One person subsequently had a rash consistent with adverse reaction to ciprofloxacin; doxycycline was substituted. No other adverse effects from chemoprophylaxis were reported, and no infections resulted from the exposures.

Device or equipment involved: vacuum pump, laminar flow hood

Procedure being performed: desiccation of viral antigen preparation

How LAI / exposure occurred: A viral antigen preparation was being desiccated in a laminar flow hood. During desiccation, negative pressure was interrupted "several times," to confirm that the vacuum pump was functioning. The paper questions whether or not the infection was laboratory-acquired or acquired in the field, and uses sequencing to confirm that the laboratory strain caused the illness.

Follow-up procedures taken: • SHG6 – Parts of the placenta, fetal organs and maternal blood (from the heart) was sent to the “Staatliche Veterinaeruntersuchungsamt Arnsberg” immediately (State Veterinarian Arnsberg, Germany) - they mention that it was fresh blood and tissue • Serum of SHG6 was tested for C Burnetii (CHE-KIT Q-FEVER) and Chlamydia-complement fixation test were run. No control serum or tissues exist from before the abortion. • Cotyledons (part of the placenta) for SHG 1-6 were fixed. Paraffin embedded tissue was sectioned (5 micron) and stained with Hematoxylin-Eosin. SHG6 sections were stained with Giemsa. • Immunohistochemistry on placentas was performed using C burnetii antiserum (they say serum! They may mean antibody?) • TEM was performed on infected cell cultures • Placenta smears were stained according to STAMP (whatever that means) • Placental tissue was grown on Columbia agar and blood agar. • Coxiella was grown in culture using Buffalo Green Monkey cells infected with aborted sample • C Burnetii and C psittaci were identified by specific amplification using primers or by no specific amplification followed by sequencing, respectively. Follow up with affected humans: patients were seen by different doctors. Human clinical analysis to detect C burnetii utilized ELISA against C burnetii Antibodies.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Unknown. The SOP: PPE – gloves, disposable lab coat (alternatively, lab coat must be cleaned immediately), unless all animal are demonstrably negative, workers need to be monitored by the company occupational physician ; disinfection of stalls 10% bleach. 1% Lysol or 1% H2O2; All tissue needs to be treated as infectious; For future work: Animals with KBR titer 1:40 should be excluded from experiments even if they look healthy; animals should be tested twice within 4 weeks; do not go by health assessment of the shepherd; consider sheering sheep and treating for ticks before the experiment. Note that some latent infections are hard to diagnose (they think the whole herd was sick even though only 3 of the 6 placentas came back positive).

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: We can speculate that the exposure occurred from rubbing an eye, or other type of eye exposure, and that eye protection would have prevented this, but this article focuses on identifying that it was a laboratory strain and not a strain found associated with Japanese pets.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: The scientist used a topical steroid for 3 days, and then sought medical attention when the infection was 15 mm on her lower left eyelid with a depressed center. Topical treatment with butanefine hydrochloride was provided for 4 days. On the second day, the immune response to the Tricophytin antigen was tested by arm injection. There was no response. However, two weeks after stopping treatment, a second injection with Tricophytin antigen showed a positive response in two days; a reaction at the site of the LAI, and the first injection, also appeared. The article has images of the infection, and the immune response.

Procedure being performed: Immunization of a rabbit

How LAI / exposure occurred: After an 8-day-old child had died with clinical signs of septicemia, 6 other newborns fell ill. Virus was isolated from various sites from all the 6 children. An accidental laboratory infection which occurred later gave the opportunity for further clinical observations. The worker suffered a needlestick injury while immunizing a rabbit with purified Porz virus. Three days later a pleurodynia was noticed, wich lasted with varying severity or more than three weeks.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Although the virus could easily be isolated from various sites of the 6 children, it was not found in mothers, other relatives, or hospital staff. In order to follow the path of infection an intensive serological investigation was undertaken, in which attempts were to recognize a recent virus infection by looking for the virus-specific IgM and IgG antibody response. Virus isolation. - Several specimens were used sucha as native CSF, rectal or pharyngeal swabs in 2 ml transport medium. All isolation attempts were made by inoculating two tube cultures each of primary African green monkey kidney (AGMK) cells and of human diploid lung fibroblasts (HEL). Cell cultures were observed daily in case of presenting or not a cytopathic effect (CPE). The clinical picture, however, sometimes suggested additional measures for the detection of noncytopathic viruses, such as haemadsorption or virus challenge with ECHO 11 (i.e., cytomegalovirus). Virus typing. - Virus isolates were typed by the serum pools of Lim and Benyesh-Melnick and by neutralization with monospecific antisera. Neutralization tests. - All tests were done as microneutralization tests using 10E25 tissue culture infective doses50. Separation of IgM and IgG antibodies. - Antibodies of the IgG and IgM classes were separated by ultracentrifugation of a serum specimen on a sucrose gradient. Immunoglobulin assay. - Immunoglobulins G and M were assayed by the Mancini technique using commercial immunodiffusion plates and standard sera. Because all the other virus isolation attemps failed, the authors tried to recognize recent Echovirus 11 infections by determining specific antibodies of the IgM and IgG classes in the sera of the children, their relatives, and their doctors and nurses. In the case of the laboratory worker, the patient was seronegative against both viruses prior to the laboratory accident (Porz virus as homologous antigen and the Gregory prototype strain as heterologous antigen). Afterwards antibodies of the IgM class appeared and were capable of neutralizing both Porz virus and Echo 11 Gregory. The peak titre obtained against the homologous antigen was much higher against the heterologous antigen. Partial cross reactivity was also shown with the IgG antibodies.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Isolation measures, in conjunction with strict hygiene, appeared to stop the outbreak immediately.

How LAI / exposure occurred: A pathologist had been working with Rift Valley fever virus for several weeks before the onset of his illness. On the evening of December 22, 1932, he felt chilly while walking home and complained that his eyes and the calves of his legs ached. He found his sublossal temperature at that time to be 99.6 °F. During the night his rest was disturbed by general malaise and pains, specially around the knees and hips. On the 2nd day of illnes, his temperature was 101°F. At this time he complained of vague soreness over his abdomen, constant dull headache, and pain behind the eyes associated with slight photophobia. There was no sore throat rhinitis, nausea, or vomiting. He was admitted to the Hospital of the Rockefeller Institute 24 hours after the onset of the symptoms.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: On the admission, the temperature was 102.6 °F, pulse 140 respirations 24. The patient was definitely postrated by his illness but rational and cooperative. The total leucocyte count at this time was 2800 per c. mm. Polymorphonuclear elements constituted 57 percent of this. Throat culture was negative for hemolytic streptococci and influenza bacilli, and blood cultures in infusion broth remained sterile. The urine showed a faint trace of albumin; no bile was present. A tentative diagnosis of Rift Valley fever or influenza was made. In an attempt to confirm the tentative diagnosis of Rift Valley fever, 6 cc. of the patient's blood, drawn on the day of admission and kept fluid by the addition of 1 cc. of 1:1000 heparin solution, was injected intraperitoneally in 1 cc. amounts into six mice. All of the mice died within 48 hours. Their livers were free from ordinary bacteria, but showed in hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections the marked focal necrosis and acidophilic intranuclear inclusions typical of Rift Valley fever. Blood taken from the patient on the day following admission gave similar results. Almost immediately after admission the patient began to improve. On the 5th day, two papular areas several centimeters in diameter were observed on the right thigh and leg. At the time of the appearance of the papules the patient developed a sore throat. The pharynx was irregularly injected and the resembled the throats often seen in cases of influenza. On the 6th day, patient developed a typical herpes simplex eruption on the right side of the nose. During all this time, the patient had been improving generally. During the 10th-45th days of illnes, the patient developed several complications such as plebitis of the popliteal vein, fever developed and an increase of the body tempearature as well as several pulmonary infarcts (at different times). Between every episode of this sypmtoms, the patient seemed to improve. On the 45th day of illness, the patient suddenly collapsed and died within a few minutes. Death was apparently due to a large embolous in the pulmonary vessels.

How LAI / exposure occurred: During the first 3 months of 1979, 11 confirmed and more than 30 presumptive cases of Q fever ocurred among researchers and employees of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). One person died. Most, if not all, of the infections were introduced by pregnant sheep used in research.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Preliminary results of a serologic survey of 580 employees revealed that 114 (19.6%) had complement-fixing antibodies (>1:8) to Coxiella burnetii. This compares with only 4 positives (0.2%) among 2,200 specimens submitted to the Microbiology Laboratory of the San Francisco Department of Public Health since routine testing of patients. At UCSF the highest prevalence of CF antibodies was in animal technicians and cage cleaners, and in those who worked on the floors where sheep were studied. Five of 9 employees who worked with soiled linen in the campus laundry had positive titers. Many other employees with positive titers had no direct contact with the research sheep, but used corridors and elevators where sheep were transported in open carts. Approximately 600 pregnant ewes are supplied annualy to UCSF researchers. In November 1978, 47% sheep in the supplier's flock were positive for Q fever antibodies.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: After 1979 outbreak, sheep were removed to a separate building, which is in the process of being brought up to the National Institues of Health's third level of containment (P3) standards through the addition of negative air pressure, air locks, and high-efficiency particulate filters on exhaust ducts. It is recommended that medical research centers using sheep take measures to minimize transmission of Q fever such as: a) Monitoring the prevalence of Q fever antibodies in sheep; b) Housing sheep in containment querters that preclude exposure of persons who do not work withsheep; c) Limiting access to persons who must work with sheep or perform essential maintenance services; d) Using acceptable microbiologic techniques to process sheep tissues; e) Sterilizing potentially contaminated fomites; f) Doing periodic serologic surveillance on investigators, animal handlers, and other potentially exposed to sheep; g) Informing persons exposed tosheep of the risks of Q fever and screening them for evidence of valvular heart disease; and h) Considering Q fever as a diagnosis in compatible illnesses.

How LAI / exposure occurred: The present investigation deals with three cases of Rift Valley fever in human individuals, in the first of which the source of the infection is obscure. The disease in the other two cases appears to have been related directly to the handling of infectious material. The virus was shown to be present in the upper respiratory tracts of two of the individuals, as demonstrated by the intranasal inoculation of ferrets with nasopharyngeal washings of both patients.

Follow-up procedures taken: Case 1. The patient, a male laboratory assistant, during the early morning of Oct. 6, 1934, felt chilly and experienced generalized aching. He was seen that afternoon by a physician, who noted no abnormal physical findings except mild injection of the throat. His temperature by mouth was 103 °F. On the following day, after antipyretics, the temperature was 99.5 °F, and the next day was normal. The aches and pains were less severe. Recovery was uneventful except that the patient complained for some time of shooting pains in his muscles. Case 2. The patient, a member of the staff, working with the virus obtained from the previous case, was suddenly awakened at 2 am with severe chills. During the day of his temperature rose to 104.5 °F, and was accompained by headache, generalized bodily pains, moderate nasal congestion, tenderness of the eyeballs, and mental confusion. Leukocyte count in the moring was 4880; in the afternoon 3720. Urine showed no abnormalities. The patient was considering to be suffering from a typical attack of influenza. The following day after the administration of antipyretics, the fever was lower, but marked backache persisted. Leukocyte count was 4780 per cent polymorphonuclear leukocytes. On the 3rd day the patient's temperature returned to normal and remained so. Convalescence proceed rapidly without complications. There persisted for some time, however pain or motion of the eyes, and a sense of imbalance. Case 3. The patient, a male laboratory assistant, actively engaged in the studies of the two previous strains of virus, was taken sick suddenly. The onset was marked by a severe chill, at which time his temperature was 99.8 °F by mouth. There was a slight cough. His throat was red and a throat culture taken at this time revealed a heavy growth of hemolytic Hemophilus influenzae. The leukocyte count was 9700. During the night his temperature was reported to have risen to 105.6°F. There was sleeplessness, some pistaxis, nausea and vomiting, a distinct sense of anxiety, and generalized aches and pains. The latter, the patient described as not being as severe as those of influenza which he had experienced 3 months previously. He was admitted to the hospital on Dec. 13, 1934, with a temperature of 103 °F and withe blood cell count of 5650 with 80% of polymorphonuclears. The urine showed no abnormalities. There was a mild but persistent nosebleed. The patient's temperature fell rapidly and he apparently had recovered completely when discharged from the hospital on the 8th day after admission. 2 days later he again develped fever, severe headache, nausea and some vomiting, and experienced dizziness for several days. Recovered proceed uninterruptedly thereafter. The transmission of Rift Valley fever to ferrets was carried out by direct inoculation of pharyngeal washings of cases 1 and 2.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The unusual feature in this outbreak of Rift Valley fever in man is that the source of infection of the first case was not definitely established. No Rift Valley fever virus had been used for study in these laboratories for 4 months prior to the onset of illness. This patient had never assisted with the actual investigative work, nor had he ever been exposed to animals used in the study. The mice which had been employed were constantly kept in a room under strict quarantine. The jars in which they were placed stood in pans of lysol, and the legs of the table on which the jars rested stood in lysol. 3 months after all animals had been removed from the room, the patient assisted in scraping and painting the walls and floor. So far as can be determined, that task was completed 15 days before the onset of the disease. Another interesting aspect of the study of the human cases of the disease is that the virus of Rift Valley fever was readily recovered from the upper respiratory tract of two of the patients during the first 3 days of the disease, whereas on the 8th day after onset the virus could not be demostrated in the throat washings of the one individual studied (case 2). These observations clearly indicate that the virus of Rift Valley fever belongs to the group of filterable viruses which may effect their entry to the human body through the respiratory tract. Further evidence of the capacity of the virus to invade by way of the respiratory tract was obtained by the inoculation of the virus into the nasal passages of ferrets. The experimental disease in the ferret is characterized by the development of extensive edematous pulmonary consolidation with a scanty exudate of large mononuclear cells. The pulmonary lesion resembles that produced in experimental animals by other virus diseases, for example influenza and psittacosis. The results indicate that the virus of Rift Valley fever belongs to the group of filterable viruses which may gain entrance to the human body through the respiratory tract.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Cases 1 and 2 both only received antipyretics.

How LAI / exposure occurred: Sixteen cases of probable laboratory-acquired meningococcal disease occurring worldwide between 1985 and 2001 were identified, including six U.S. cases between 1996 and 2000. Nine cases (56%) were serogroup B; seven (44%) were serogroup C. Eight cases (50%) were fatal. All cases occurred among clinical microbiologists. In 15 cases (94%), isolate manipulation was performed without respiratory protection. We estimated that an average of three microbiologists are exposed to the 3,000 meningococcal isolates seen in U.S. laboratories yearly and calculated an attack rate of 13/100,000 microbiologists between 1996 and 2001, compared to 0.2/100,000 among U.S. adults in general.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure:

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure:

Follow-up procedures taken: N. meningitidis is classified as a biosafety level 2 organism, and current guidelines recommend that a biosafety cabinet be used for mechanical manipulation of samples that carry with them a significant risk of droplet formation or aerosolization; such procedures, as outlined, include “centrifuging, grinding, blending, vigorous shaking or mixing, sonic disruption, opening containers of infectious materials whose internal pressures may be different from ambient pressures, inoculating animals intranasally, and harvesting infected tissues from animals or embryonate eggs.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Specific risk factors for laboratory-acquired infection are likely associated with exposure to droplets or aerosols containing N. meningitidis. Prevention should focus on the implementation of class II biological safety cabinets or additional respiratory protection during manipulation of suspected meningococcal isolates. Microbiologists who manipulate invasive N. meningitidis isolates in a manner that could induce droplet or aerosol formation (including plating, subculturing, and serogrouping) on an open benchtop and in the absence of effective protection from droplets or aerosols should also consider antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Laboratorians with percutaneous exposure to an invasive N. meningitidis isolate from a sterile site should receive treatment with penicillin; those with known mucosal exposure should receive antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis.

Procedure being performed: Unknown

How LAI / exposure occurred: The patient was a 70-year-old man, an active pathologist known to have performed or assisted at more than 14,000 autopsy examinations during his career in southeastern California. His practice included flying to a number of countries in the area that had no resident pathologist in order to perform autopsies. No single record of his numerous autopsies exists, and authors are, at present, unable to answer the imortant question of whether or not the patient was exposed to a patient with an unusual dementia or one with established CJD. On June 15, 1990 he was discovered by his daughter to be speaking with difficulty, repeating and mimicking sentences and omitting workds from his dictations, and was unable to remember names well. Colleagues had noted forgetfulness and incontinence beginning in May 1990. By July, he was mute and incontinent, and had decorticate posturing of the right uper extremity with myoclonic jerks. Patient died of pneumonia in a nursing home on August 6, 1990.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: After the presentation of all syptoms, serum and CSF studies were taken resulting in normal values, including human immunodeficiency virus antibody titer, although a low serum B12 was discovered. Replacement with B12 injections did not change the clinical course. MRI showed a small left thalamic infarct and generalized atrophy, more pronounced in the left cerebral hemisphere. EEG showed triphasic waves and generalized slowing. Because of his asymetric presentation, a PET was obtained. This revealed diffuse, symmetric cortical hypometabolism, consistent with a generalized process such as CJD. After dead, autopsy was limited to the brain, with biopsies of kidney and lung. The lung demonstrated pneumonia. Gross examination of the brain showed neocortical neuron loss, spongy change, and severe, focal astrocytic gliosis, changes characteristic of CJD. The cerebellum showed spongy change as well. No amyloid deposits were noted.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: This case represents the first pathologist to have died of CJD, an established infectious disease caused by an unusual infectious agent. Although there is no evidence of transmission from infected tissue, and spontaneous mutation is also possible, the case emphasizes the need for care and precautions to be taken in handling potentially contaminated material at autopsy, especially from patients with a dementia of unknown or cryptogenetic origin.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: No prophylaxis was stated in this article.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Research laboratory

Device or equipment involved: Unknown

Procedure being performed: Animal and human specimen handling

How LAI / exposure occurred: In May, 1992, a 55-year-old orthopaedic surgeon developed paraesthesia of the left arm. The patient had worked with sheep and human dura mater from 1968 to 1972. He handled about 150 specimens of ovine origin and at least a dozen human preparations for research. Handling involved opening skulls with a band saw, removing dura, and testing them either fresh (usually), preserved, or lyophilised for mechanical qualities. These specimens were sent to a company that has sold dura mater preparations by which CJD was transmitted in six instances. No information was available from the company about a possible connection with this patient's disease and the arlier cases of transmitted CJD. A few days later he had spatial disorientation, apraxia, and gait ataxia. In June he was admitted and a neurologist suspected CJD on the basis of the clinical signs, typical electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern, and history. An EEG in June revealed a typical pattern of periodic biphasic and triphasic sharp wave complexes. Authors saw the patient in July and was awake and oriented, with dyscalculia, dysgraphia, disturbed vision, apraxia mainly of the left side, rigidity of wrists, spasticity of all muscles, myoclonus of the left arm, increased tendon reflexes, ataxia of limbs and trunk, and incoordination of left arm.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Brain biopsy was consistent with diagnosis of CJD. Cerebrospinal fluid obtained in July showed neuron-specific enolase (NSE) at 82,0 ng/mL, compared with 16,7 ng/mL in serum of other cases. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of parieto-occipital and temporal grey matter, parietal white matter, and thalamus revealed a 20-30% reduction of N-acetylaspartate, as described. DNA was genotyped with allele-specific oligonucleotides and was homozygous for methionine at the polymorphic codon 129. Subsequent direct DNA sequencing for the PrP gene open-readling rame demonstrated normal sequence on both alleles, excluding known or novel pathogenic PrP mutations. It is tempting to speculate that prions were transmitted to this patient from sheep or human dura mater through small lacerations of his skin, but the patient and his wife did not remember any significant injury during his four years of working with these samples.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: It cannot be excluded that this was a case of sporadic CJD although this assumption is unlikely in view of the clinical course which was similar to iatrogenic CJD transmitted by peripheral inoculation, such as with human pituitary growth hormone or gonadotropin or to kuru. Iatrogenic cases resulting from intracerebral inoculation with the transmissible agent, for instance following dura mater grafts, present with a dementing picture, as is isual in sporadic CJD, rather than with ataxia as in this case.

Device or equipment involved:

Procedure being performed: Virulence Testing; studying infections of abalone, a food crop.

How LAI / exposure occurred: When Taiwan was hit with the Chi-Chi earthquake on September 21, 1999, shortages in electricity and water supplies resulted. The infected worker handled moribund small abalones infected with 2 strains of V. parahemolyticis; both strains were recovered from the LAI's stool. Our present results suggest that a V. parahaemolyticus strain isolated from the stool of a patient with gastroenteritis was infectious for small abalone, a major species of edible mollusk abalone cultured in Taiwan, while a similar strain isolated from hemolymph of a diseased small abalone was infectious for humans. This is the first report of V. parahaemolyticus virulent to small abalone as a zoonotic pathogen.

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Unknown. The authors state the conditions after the earthquake (lack of water, electricity) impacted the maintenance of higher levels of sanitation and hygiene, leading to the LAI.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Unknown

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Unknown if any was provided. One of the strains used in the experiment was isolated from the stool of lab workers who ate raw tuna in a restaurant and became infected; they recovered spontaneously.

How LAI / exposure occurred: Case 1: A 62-y-old woman had been employed in the neuropathology facility at an academic medical center for 22 years. Her duties shared with two others, included rinsing formalin-fixed brains and processing, cutting, and staining sections of brain; she did not participate in actual brain cutting. Case 2: A 75-y-old right handed histologist presented to our hospital with deteriorating mental status. The patient died of massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage three weeks after admission to the hospital. Questioning of the patient's family and colleagues revealed that he had been exposed to both animal and human brains before 1969. In 1963 and 1964, he was active in dissecting shep for histologic investigation.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Follow-up procedures taken: Case 1: Patient's first symptom was a subtle difficulty with balance when walking, suggestive of Ménière's disease, but over the course of a year she had progressive difficulty with language, gait and cognition. During her terminal hospitalization she had startle myoclonus and was clinically thought to have typical CJD. Pieces of the brain obtained at autopsy were sent to the authors in formalin by the local pathologist, for consultation. Sections of the cerebral cortex and cerebellum revealed a variable loss of neurons, astrogliosis, and typical spongiform changes. Neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles were not present. Case 2: Neurologic examination revealed a right homonymous hemianopia, but no other abnormalities. The cerebrospinal fluid was clear and colorless, with 1 red cell per cubic milimeter, no white cells, a glucose level of 4.6 mmol per liter, and a total protein level of 670 mg per liter. CT scanning of the brain, Doppler study of the carotid arteries, echocardiography, and antinuclear-antibody assay revealed no abnormalities. Over the next week, the patient became stuporous, with episodic eye deviation to the right side. Startle myoclonus and upgoing plantar responses subsequently developed. The electroencephalogram showed diffuse slowing but no triphasic waves. A diagnosis of CJD was made. Neuropathological examination revealed spongy degeneration, neuronal drop-out, and astrocytic gliosis, most severe in the occipital lobes. Similar, less advanced changes were found in the basal ganglia, anterior thalamus, geniculate body, insula cingulate gyrus, and remainder of the cortex.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Case 1: The occurrence of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in this technician raises the question of whether her illness was acquired occupationally. A review of the logbooks in the laboratory where she worked revealed that during her tenure, two persons among those autopsied had a diagnosis of CJD. In one of these cases the disease was successfully transmitted to a nonhuman primate. The two cases were seen 16 and 11 years before the onset of patint's neurologic deterioration. The neuropathologist who worked on both brains remains healthy and active. The author believed that the association of occupation and disease in this case needs reporting so that we can continue assessing potential risks to our laboratory personnel honestly. Case 2: The mode of transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in our patient is unknown. Iatrogenic transmission through corneal transplants, stereotactic equipment, human growth hormone, and dura mater grafts has been described. Other possible risks factors include intraocular pressure testing, injury to or surgery on the face, head, or neck, and ingestion of animal brains or eyes. Incubation is long (30-40 years) - and its length could be determined genetically, as in experimental scrapie in mice. Although this may prepresent a spontaneous case, the history of exposure to sheep and human brain tissue in the workplace must be considered a possible causative factor in our patient.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: A medical waste processing facility where infectious wastes were shredded and then microorganisms were inactivated in an oven using a heating process, electro thermal deactivation

Device or equipment involved: Medical waste shredder and compression system feeding into an electro thermal deactivation heat treatment system

Procedure being performed: Infectious waste arrived via truck and employees used a hand truck to carry plastic bins of waste to the loading area for the waste shredder (in-feed station). Containers were opened and waste was dumped onto a conveyor belt feeding into the shredder. The empty container was passed to a tub wash station where pressurized water was sprayed on the inside of the container for cleaning. Shredded waste was blown through a ducted system into containers which were then compressed by an employee operating a hydraulic press. Once pressed and capped the containers were placed on a conveyor belt and fed into the oven.

How LAI / exposure occurred: Extensive investigation indicated that multiple factors contributed to employee infections with several distinct antibiotic-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Personnel were not required to wear respiratory protection in areas where engineering controls were thought to be sufficient to control potential exposures. Personnel did not routinely wear PPE correctly (e.g. face shields were not always worn or kept lowered). Reversal of air from the shredder compartment to the main work space was observed during clogging events, which occurred frequently. Lines for supplied air respirators were in disrepair, equipment was not cleaned, and re-pairs had been made without advice from manufacturer resulting in a system configuration that was not NIOSH approved. The entire facility was negatively pressurized in relation to the outside and re-entrainment of exhaust air was identified in several areas. Finally, dumping, shredding, and pressing waste without prior decontamination resulted in aerosolization of infectious agents as determined by studies spiking waste with dye and/or indicator microorganisms.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Face shield, Safety glasses, Full body suit, Single pair of protective gloves,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Other engineering control,

Follow-up procedures taken: Recommendations were made to 1) require decontamination of waste at the generation site prior to disposal; 2) provide appropriate occupational health programs and training for blood borne pathogens and tuberculosis; 3) redesign entry to containment area to set up separate clean and dirty traffic zones; 4) enforce employee shower out requirements; 5) provide appropriate respiratory protection and other PPE to all employees; 6) implement a safety awareness training program for employees; 7) develop written operating procedures; 8) install a supplemental ventilation system to prevent reversals of airflow at the in-feed chute; and 9) ensure that exhaust HEPA filters are tested and certified annually and that preventive maintenance for all equipment is per-formed and appropriately documented.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Appropriate engineering controls, proper equipment and PPE maintenance, provision of respiratory protection to all employees, as well as requiring waste to be decontaminated prior to transport and/or shredding, in addition to recommendations described under follow-up procedures may have reduced exposure.

Procedure being performed: Unknown

How LAI / exposure occurred: Nine patients were identified from the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) who were performing research into the pathogenesis and immunology of rickettsial diseases, including development of vaccines to this agent. There were no reports of tick bites or parenteral exposure in this group. Investigation of each case revealed definitive or probable exposure to aerosols containing infectious rickettsiae. Two illustrative case reports were cited in the paper: Case 3. A researcher presenting with fever, fatigue, myalgia and headache was diagnosed with Rocky Mountain fever following positive diagnosis via immunologic assays. Investigation revealed the researcher was injecting guinea pigs with R. rickettsii when the needle popped off the syringe and the contents sprayed into the air and spattered onto the hands and faces of the workers. Safety glasses prevented conjunctival contamination. Workers immediately washed themselves and cleaned up the spill. Case 9. A veterinary technician presenting with chills, headache, fever and a rash was diagnosed with Rocky Mountain fever following positive diagnosis via immunologic assays. The patient was not involved in any studies with R. rickettsii, but noted he had spent ~15 minutes in a laboratory chatting with another technician who was pipetting R. rickettsii in a laminar hood one week before onset of illness.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Safety glasses, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Laminar flow cabinet, Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Of the nine identified patients, data was only provided for two illustrative case patients: Case 3. Laboratory diagnosis via Weil-Felix OX19 serological assay and an indirect fluorescent-antibody assay. Isolation of R. ricketsii from pre-treatment blood samples. Case 9. Laboratory diagnosis via agglutination assay. Culture from blood and throat specimens and "Mono spot" test were negative.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Preventative measures include the recommendation for completion of primary vaccination series and booster immunizations for researchers working with R. rickettsii. While the risk for aerosol transmission of R. rickettsii in the laboratory was identified, specific subsequent actions to minimize future risk of exposure to personnel was not described in the text.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Of the nine identified patients, data was only provided for two illustrative case patients: Case 3. Tetracycline 4g/day by mouth. Case 9. Tetracycline 500mg every 6h intravenously

Follow-up procedures taken: Investigation by the Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) on November 26. The BPHC toured the animal facility and the research laboratory noting that both areas were well maintained, with proper biosafety signage, certified biosafety cabinets, disinfectants and waste containers. The laboratory protocols and the VACV vaccination recommendations for staff were also reviewed.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: This incident prompted the academic institution to outline biosafety measures for working with biologic agents, such as biosafety training of laboratory personnel, vaccination (if appropriate), and steps in incident reporting. This case is unusual in that it is the first documented LAI in a recently vaccinated individual. Re-capping should be prohibited.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Patient was admitted to the hospital and given cefazolin intravenously, 1 g every 6 hours for 18 hours. He was discharged on November 24 with a prescription for cephalexin, 500 mg orally four times a day for 10 days. A dressing was placed over the wound, and he vas instructed to change the dressing three times a day and dispose of the contents in a biohazard container provided by the hospital.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Clinical microbiology laboratory

Device or equipment involved: Biosafety cabinet class II and bench procedures

Procedure being performed: Processing bronchoalveolar lavage sample (BAL) and cultures

How LAI / exposure occurred: The clinical microbiology laboratory of Clinica Alemana is a BSL-2 faciltiy that performs more than 150,000 tests annually. In August 2017, a brochoalveolar lavage sample from a 20-year-old man was processed according to SOPs in a class II BSC. According to the investigation and analysis, the exposure occurred during benchtop procedures within open-space laboratory at days 7, 13 and 17, when cultures were handled outside of BSC-II (without contravening current national laboratory biosafety guidelines which do not include the management of mold cultures).

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Biological safety cabinet,

Follow-up procedures taken: After the obtained results from day 13th (observation of primary cultures) and day 17th (results from authomatized equipments), an emergency meeting with the head of the clinical laboratory members was carried out. In addition, oral and written information for laboratory personnel and outsourced cleanning staff was done. a) An environmental containment was done by shutdown of air conditioning, closure of microbiology laboratory, thorough cleanning and disinfection of all exposed areas with chlorine 10% solution, and sealing of cultures before inactivation; b) In addition, contact of attending physicians to obtain clinic-epidemiological information; c) Literature search and contact of national and international reference centers for advice regarding management of exposure and diagnosis; and d) Reconstruction of timeline of all procedures related to the sample, including dates and locations of involved personnel withing the different laboratory areas. The event affected 44 persons including physicians, laboratory technologists and technicians, and cleaning personnel; four were classified as a high-risk and the remaining 40 as low-risk exposure. Bood samples were drawn at baseline and after 6 weeks, and clinical follow-up was established for three months. In cooperation with an international reference centre in Germany, serum samples were tested fro Coccidioides-specific antibodies by immunodiffusion (ID), complement fixation (CF), and a newly marketed lateral flow (LF) assay. As an important aspect was that one worker from the outsourced cleaning service was lost to follow-up.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: In this report, a retrospective analysis revealed that the patient had suffered pneumonia three weeks previously during travel to AZ, U.S.A., and was followed for multifocal radiological residual lesions. The event was managed with the einterdisciplinary help of other departments of the hospital and expert institutions in Chile. High-risk was defined as any manipulation of open culture plates outside of a BSC, whereas low-risk included the exposure withing a range of 8 feet (2,5 m) of any high-risk procedure. Although in this reporte no infection was detected among the exposed individuals, the event caused substantial disruption of the routine work, anxiety, and costs: furthermore, those at high risk had the inconvenience and side effects of antigungal prophylaxis. On the other hand, the biosafety procedures and measures were reinforced and modified and the personnel retrained accordingly. The communication with the laboratory in cases of the clinical suspicion of aerosol transmissible agents, which is an important factor for laboratory safety, was also reinforced.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: As suggested by some experts, a chemoprophylaxis with fluconazole 400 mg once daily for six weeks for high-risk exposures were recommended. From the staff that initiated chemoprophylaxis (4), all reported minor side effects (cheilitis, myalgia) that lead to suspnsion of chemoprophylaxis in one of them. Serological results of all post-exposure samples were negative with standard tests, but positive for the index patient with appropriate positive and negative controls.

Follow-up procedures taken: All patients met the national clinical criteria of HFRS, required hospitalization, and were treated in Shenyang Infectious Hospital. Fever, proteinuria, and mild hemorrhagic complications were observed in all patients, but without the distinct clinical stages seen in the severe form of the disease caused by HTNV.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Serologic and genetic analyses suggest that the HFRS outbreak was caused by transmission of SEOV, which was circulating among local wild rats; the wild rats passed the virus to laboratory rats, which then infected humans.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Research laboratory

Device or equipment involved: Amicon 402 stirred cell

Procedure being performed: Research using virulent NDV for new diagnostic tests

How LAI / exposure occurred: A technician was concentrating a preparation of virulent Newcastle disease virus using ultra-filtration involving an Amicon 402 stirred cell. The concentration work was carried out in a cold room. Unfortunately, the ultra-filter membrane was not in the bottom of the stirred cell so when pressure was applied to the cell a significant quantity of virus was squirted into the technician´s eye. The technician left the cold room and reported the incident to her line manager who instructed her to clean up the spill. This incident was likely to be a difficult one to manage for the laboratory and could result in significant political and community ramifications. The AAHL Security Assessment Group (ASAG) was asked to investigate the incident and the laboratory also carried out its own internal investigation. Very soon, the incident became a major issue in the news. On one day, three helicopters from local television stations arrived at the laboratory; there were calls for the laboratory to be closed down, and for a Royal Commission to be held into its operations. Critics of the establishment of AAHL became very vocal and argued that organisms could not be safely contained and even that the whole of the Australian economy was threatened.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure:

Follow-up procedures taken: The microbiological security officer at AAHL was alerted through the central monitoring system (CMS) that the incident had occurred. The Technician was counseled that she could develop conjunctivitis and to let the laboratory know if anything happened. She went home and the following week reported that she had developed conjunctivitis. Overall, the staff involved felt that this was a minor incident and that there was unlikely to be any impact on the poultry industry. Senior members of management were absent from the site and there were significant problems with internal communications. It was only when the technician developed conjunctivitis that the Acting Head of the LAboratory and the manager of the Newcastle disease research became aware of the incident.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: As a result of the NDV incident, an entire risk classification system for animal pathogens was developed, Standard Operating Procedures were thoroughly documented and implemented, quarantine procedures and medical advice for staff established, and communication and incident reporting systemas enhanced. In order to work with Biosafety Level 4 agents in animals, management initiatives included rigorous physical audits of facilities and equipment, formal approval of training to Biosafety Level 4 and qualified teams, rigid experimental protocols designed to minimize unusual interventions, and formal structures for responsibility and accountability were implemented. Following the incident standard operating procedures at AAHL were developed. In addition, it was identified that more emphasis need to be placed upon agents that could infect humans and that not all agents should be treated in the same manner. A special isolation room for Newcastle disease work was set up, together with the establishment of a motel-like unit to restrict exposed staff to site.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Animal holding room

Device or equipment involved: Unknown

Procedure being performed: Rat handling

How LAI / exposure occurred: Between January and July 1977 four people who worked in an animal suite houseing LOU/M/Wsl rats developed symptoms similar to those of hantavirus infection. These persons had been exposed to the rats from April 1975, the time when they were introduced from the University of Louvain, Belgium. From early 1976, rat immunocytomas also were introduced from Louvain for passage into the LOU/M/ Wsl strain of rat, the procedures being performed by the same persons. The work with rats and immunocytomas was done within a small confined animal unit containing a rat operating theatre and with an adjacent post-mortem (PM) room in which the four persons worked for long periods. Unwanted rat tissue and carcases were placed in an automated macerator (sigtuated in the PM room) beore disposal into the domestic sewerage system. The macerator did not have any safety lock or seal on the lid and was frequently opened mid-cycle to add further animal tissue. The ventilation flowed from input vents in the ceiling over the macerator and toward the exit vent situated by the door. This, coupled with back-tracking of macerator waste into the operating theatre sink, could have resulted in the generation and emission of aerosols into the immediate vicinity, including corridors and other rooms of the animal unit.

Follow-up procedures taken: The clinical illness observed in these workers ranged from mild to severe. Three of the four were in hospital for 2 - 3 weeks and all required additional 4 - 13 weeks of convalescence. All of them had clinical features of classical KHF - an early toxic reaction characterised by fever, myalgia, weakness, petechiae, sore throat, dysphagia and diaphoresis, oliguria, proteinuria, raised blood urea nitrogen, and diuresis with fluctuating electrolyte concentrations and varying degrees of anaemia. Serum was not available rom the period of illness from any of the patients but three samples of serum obtained during 1984 were tested for antibodies.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Other laboratory personnel who worked during the same period were also studied retrospectively. Five of six people found to be seropositive to hantavirus had worked in other parts of the animal unit and had not had any direct contact with the LOU rats or their tissues. Nine of ten workers associated with the animal unit during the period of the infection had significant titres of hantavirus antibodies. It should be noted that five of these workers did not report any ill effects suggesting the possibility of a laboratory-derived inapparent infection. Studies of other persons working within the laboratory but not with animals revealed only one with seroconversion, a person in other group and whose contact was confined to handling immunocytomas removed from rats. Direct contact with animals was never made because the person concerned was allergic to animal fur. Her only exposure was through homogenising the solid immunocytomas in the laboratory, a procedure which was confined to a small area designed for that purpose. The remaining five workers in the laboratory were not involved with processing immunocytomas. The homogeneisation procedure suggested additional risks from aerosol transmission to infection. Other group (D) consisted of 12 laboratory workers based in other parts of the building. Hantavirus antibodies were not found in their sera indicating that hantavirus infection had been confined to those people associated with the animal unit (groups A and or with the laboratory processing of immunocytomas derived from LOU rats (group C). In nine persons employed since 1981 (group E) and working in both the laboratory and the animal unit there was not anyevidence of seroconversion to hantavirus. None of these had worked with LOU rats or immunocytomas. Attention must also be drawn to the use of laboratory rats in general because many workers have demonstrated laboratory and wild rats to be potential carriers of hantavirus. SInce the rat does not display any observable clinical features and is widely used in many scientific disciplines, it would apprear that a screening procedure to define hantavirus-free stocks is needed.

How LAI / exposure occurred: The present report includes 3 patients with an exposure history of working with brucella bacteria in a micorbiology laboratory. No accident ocurred in the laboratory during the time they were exposed. All 3 cases were found to be working on the specimen of the index case patient. Index case was a 45-year-old man who had Brucella serology of 1/640 and blood culture that grew B. melitensis. only 3 of the microbiology staff work on the specimen. Proposed route of transmission: Aerosol

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Single pair of protective gloves, Half mask respirator,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Biological safety cabinet,

Follow-up procedures taken: Laboratories shuld be aware of laboratory-associated hazards and take adequate safety precautions even including the use of biosafety cabinet, gloves and masks.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: All laboratory workers should be educated periodically for occupational risks in the laboratory. All microbiology laboratory staff were educated concerning laboratory-acquired bacterial infetions. The laboratory staff are discouraged from smelling the culture plaques. In addition in order to prevent future infections, close collaboration between clinicians and laboratory staff was initiated. Biosafety level 3 has to be advocated and used when working with micro-organisms such as Brucella spp. In addition clinicians should alert laboratory personnel if they suspect Brucellosis in patients so they can take extra precautions.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Case 1: A combination of rifampin + ceftriaxone was preferred instead of the combination of rifampin + doxycycline. This reason because Case 1, had given birth 2 weeks prior and was breastfeeding. Case 2: 2 g of cetriaxone plus 600 mg of rifampin every day for 6 weeks. Case 3: Doxycycline 100 mg po twice daily and rifampin 600 mg po qd for 6 weeks.

Follow-up procedures taken: After exhaustive negative testing for human infectious diseases, whole genome sequencing (WGS) was parformed on the patient's bone marrow aspirate, using an Illumina NextSeq500 platform. Conventional PCR followed by Sanger sequencing were then performed on blood samples using novel Mycoplasma-specific primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene. In addition, a Mycoplasma-specific fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) assay was developed to differentiate Mycoplasma cells from other erythrocyte inclusions, which are morphologically similar to bacterial cocci by light microscopy.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Relatively few cases of human haemotropic Mycoplasma infections have been reported in the literature. Whilst other members of the genus Mycoplasma commonly infect humans, haemoplasmas are best recognised as causing disease in domestic animals that range from asymptomatic infections to severe, life-threatening illness. Haemoplasmas cannot be cultured, and historically, infection has been diagnosed on the basis of blood smear cytological examination wich has low sensitivity and specificity. The utilization of broad range eubacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene PCR may detect the presence of bacteria but has varied sensitivity and specificity, as was seen in our case who had a negative test on blood and spleen tissue. The expansion of molecular diagnostics has resulted in increased characterization of novel haemoplasmas and the subsequent identification of potential zoonotic pathogens. In addition, this report highlights the importance of increased vigilance by the medical profession for patients presenting with unusual symptoms upopn close associations with animals.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: The patient was treated for six days with intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam without clinical improvement. Doxyciclyne was initiated on the recommendation of the infectious diseases team. The patient was discharged on doxycycline but only completed 5 days of the prescribed 14 days. Due to the obtained results by the laboratory and clinical findings, prednisolone was stared with good effect and the patient discharged on a weaning dose but re-presented in September 2018 unwell. Given the extensive potential for zoonotic infection, itraconazole (later amphotericin), piperacillin-tazobactam and azithromycin were commenced.

Follow-up procedures taken: The paper was written to promote better awareness among Clinicians of the signs and symptoms of Brucella suis infections, the epidemiology of infection. Particular emphasis was placed on the area surrounding Townsville, Australia; an area where feral pig hunting is popular resulting in a large number of infections. The Brucella suis LAI was highlighted in order to emphasize that some infections may be acquired in a laboratory setting.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The emphasis of the publication was on rapid clinical diagnosis but notes that, "Altered recreational and occupational hunting practices, such as wearing personal protective equipment and increased sanitation, were adopted by 52% (n = 13) of patients after initial diagnosis of brucellosis.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Optimal antibiotic therapy for brucellosis is still debated. Therefore, many different regimens are used. The most commonly prescribed regimen in northern Australia was a triple therapy combination of doxycycline, gentamicin, and rifampicin (38%, n = 12) for a mean duration of more than six weeks. One patient in the current study received inadequate treatment with a monotherapy regimen, which has been associated with unacceptably high relapse rates. Relapse is usually a consequence of inadequate treatment or non-compliance. In the study, relapse occurred in 9% of the cases. In all patients who showed relapse or in whom complications developed, treatment was deemed appropriate.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured:

Device or equipment involved: Microbiology laboratory which also functions as a regional public health laboratory

Procedure being performed: The procedure conducted in the clinical laboratory was “culturing MRSA”.

How LAI / exposure occurred: Clinical laboratorians were tested for MRSA as part of an effort to improve the technique for culturing this microbe. Nasal specimens were collected from all the laboratorians. MRSA paediatric strain 5 and the New York/Japan strain 8 were detected in two individuals, respectively. Repeat cultures from the laboratorian with Strain 5 confirmed to be a prolonged carrier. Although the MRSA strain 5 had been cultured in the lab two months earlier, it had not been detected in routine weekly surveys of the laboratory tables.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Laboratory technician who tested positive for MRSA Strain 5 was provided counseling by an employee health physician, administration of antibiotics, consultation with ear, nose and throat specialist including specific examination and treatment. All other laboratory staff and medical personnel were screened for MRSA (nose and throat). During this screening, a second laboratorian tested positive for MRSA, but the strain was the New York/Japan 8 strain. The second laboratory technician was provided the same care and follow up. Close relatives of the two MRSA-positive laboratory technicians were tested with negative results. Lastly, the hypothesis of laboratory-acquired infection was strengthened by the absence of the following risk factors: history of intravenous drugs use, hemodialysis, recent surgery or hospitalization, percutaneous catheterization, skin disease, visit to skilled nursing facilities, use of antibiotics, routine use of hot tubs or saunas, or travel to areas endemic for community-acquired MRSA. Floor and horizontal surfaces in the lab and office (the first technician spent about 30% of the time in the office) were screened by wiping with 10x10 gauze strips which were investigated for MRSA in enrichment broth and culture on agar plates. Initial investigation showed MRSA positive surfaces in the office. Cleaning and disinfection of the office space was followed by removal of administrative office materials which were submitted for gamma sterilization off-site.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The two laboratory technicians were temporarily excluded from work until clearance from MRSA was achieved, similar to the procedure followed for the clinical department and other healthcare workers. In addition, the following measures were taken in the laboratory: 1. Intensified cleaning and decontamination procedures in the lab; 2. Analyzed history of positive patients and conduct follow up cultures to determine possible laboratory contamination; 3. Screened laboratory technicians conducting MRSA cultures if an isolate found in a patient was not confirmed in repeat cultures from the same patient; 4. strengthened personnel training and stress the application of universal precautionary measures to prevent self-inoculation with laboratory- associated microbial pathogens. Regular screening of laboratory technician is not indicated. Screening of laboratory technician is done when there is an inexplicable detection of MRSA in a patient culture.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Decolonization treatment with Mupirocin nose ointment and povidone iodine scrub. After completion of the treatment, laboratory technicians were followed up weekly and then monthly for six months. After negative cultures were obtained for the entire period, the technicians were declared free of MRSA.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Research laboratory

Device or equipment involved: needle from vacutainer sleeve

Procedure being performed: Disconnecting the needle from the vacutainer sleeve after taking blood from an anesthetized SIV-infected macaque

How LAI / exposure occurred: A technician in a research laboratory was pricked by a blood-contaminated needle while disconnecting the vacutainer sleeve from the needle after taking blood from an anesthetized SIV-infected macaque. The needle which was visibly contaminated with blood, penetrated a latex glove and produced a deep puncture wound and bleeding of the worker's thumb. The wound was scrubbed immediately with povidone-iodine followed by 10% bleach. Inflammation and swelling developed at the wound site and persisted for several days.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Single pair of protective gloves,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: The wound was scrubbed immediately with povidone-iodine followed by 10% bleach. The technician was monitored and did not have any illness suggestive of acute retroviral infection and remained well with no clinical or laboratory evidence of immunodeficiency. Serum was tested from 1 week before the incident, 1 week after, and collected monthly for 19 months following the accident. From June 1990 to March 1991, serum was reactive to several peptides derived from the transmembrane region of SIV and HIV-2. Antibody titre peaked between June and August 1990. 1 month after the accident and monthly for 1 year thereafter, peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from the worker for culture. Primary culture and co-cultures with normal human PBMCs were maintained for 4 weeks and examined every 3 days, no cytopathic effect was seen. Cultures were also negative for SIV by PCR. PCR was performed in 2 difference laboratories as per the primers and probes described in the article, all were negative for SIV. Then, 13 months after the accident, 10 ml of blood from the worker was inoculated into a healthy, SIV-negative macaque. The monkey was bled every 2 weeks or monthly for 10 months after inoculation, serum samples were negative for SIV by EIA and PCR.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Taking greater care, being highly cautious, and adhering strictly to recommended procedures would minimize accidental exposures.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: The wound was scrubbed immediately with povidone-iodine followed by 10% bleach. Other follow-up was performed as described in the follow-up procedures section. At the time of publication, this was the first report of a person who after percutaneous exposure to SIV-infected macaque blood, showed evidence of seroconversion within months of exposure. Efforts to isolate virus from the blood or to find SIV provirus by PCR were unsuccessful. The authors also failed to transmit SIV by inoculating a macaque with the technician's blood. These negative results, coupled with declining titires after the serological peak at 3-5 months post-exposure suggest that the subject has not become persistently infected with SIV. It was that that it was unclear whether the serological response was a vaccination-like effect or a xenotypic response.

Device or equipment involved: unknown

Procedure being performed: This is a review of laboratory exposures to fungal pathogens when handling medical specimens, cultures, biopsies, and autopsy tissues

How LAI / exposure occurred: Three lab-acquired infections by C. immitis were briefly described. Case 1: The student opened the heavily sporing plate of old dry culture and disturbed the spored with a breath. Case 2: Biochemist wore a gauze mask while scraping the colonial growth into a grinding vessel because there was a lot of dust being generated. Case 3: A fatal outcome occurred in a disseminated infection with meningitis in an ancillary laboratory worker whose job entailed collection, autoclaving and cleaning of discards from laboratories. A common form of infection from tissue specimens and body fluids is by direct contact, either skin puncture or wound contamination. Several cases of coccidioidomycosis Wilson JW, et al 1953 histoplasmosis Tosh et al. 1964 and blastomycosis Schwarz J et al. 1951 have been reported. Potential routes of infection when handling clinical samples infected with fungi are airborne infection by inhaling aerosolized conidia, disturbing the layer of conidia, dropping the culture plate, contact or transcutaneous route if there is a wound.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Other PPE, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Case 1: Eight days after exposure, the student developed severe pleuritic pains. After suffering fever, cough and rapid weight loss, pneumonia eventually cleared and he was sent on a long vacation to Arizona Case 2: Seven days later, the biochemist developed an acute infection with erythema nodosum, pneumonia, and general malaise but went on to recover.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: This review presents recommendations for handling clinical specimens known or unknow to contain fungi. At the Mycology Reference Public Health Laboratory in Briston, UK, any specimens from deep tissue, lower respiratory tract samples and specimens from patients with hepatitis B, HIV infection, or tuberculosis are processed there as well as unknown moulds for identification which have come from deep body sites or from skin lesions suggestive of a deeper pathology. The requirement for containment includes the use of a dedicated containment level 3 laboratory for the group species and for those specimens suspected of containing them. Other recommendations include 1. Culture tubes or narrow-neck bottles with agar slopes should be used (never Petri dishes or plates). 2. The inoculation of these should be at the base of the slope, to discourage the fungus from reaching the neck of the tube. 3. Needle mounts (not adhesive tape mounts) should be made using a needle or loop, wetted in the agar adjacent to the colony before touching it onto the sporing area. 4. Cultures should be examined frequently and discarded as soon as possible after the sporing structures reveal their identity. 5. Many laboratories may require the suspected pathogen to be examined by a reference laboratory. 6. Avoid handling old, heavily sporing culture.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Animal research facility

Device or equipment involved: Unknown

Procedure being performed: Unknown

How LAI / exposure occurred: A Ph.D. student was accidentally bitten by a ZIKV-infected mouse during animal manipulation on day 6 post-infection. The adult interferon (IFN) α/β/γR−/− (AG129) transgenic mouse had been inoculated with 10^6 plaque-forming units of the Brazilian strain ZIKV (GenBank accession number MF352141). The mouse bite was on the student’s right-hand finger, perforated the glove, and produced bleeding.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Single pair of protective gloves,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: On June 29, 2017, a 30-year-old PhD student arrived at General Clementino Fraga Filho hospital complaining of symptoms that included low-grade fever, cutaneous rash, itching, and headache that started 1 day earlier. These symptoms persisted for 6 days. After that, the patient recovered without medical interventions. ZIKV diagnosis was well documented in this case through viral RNA detection by RT-PCR in both human and experimentally infected mouse. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in the patient. Dengue IgG antibody was negative on Panbio Dengue IgG indirect ELISA. Due to the continued transmission of ZIKV in Brazil, it was important to determine if this infection had been community-acquired or attributed to a laboratory accident secondary to a ZIKV-infected mouse bite. Virus whole-genome sequencing was performed using short amplicons (approximately 500 base pairs) covering the whole genome and sequenced using samples from the infected human and mouse. The phylogenetic reconstruction showed that the mouse inoculated ZIKV strain (GenBank accession numbers MT078739 and MT078740) and patient -isolated ZIKV (GenBank accession number MT078742) recovered sequences were grouped at the same branch in a single clade. Human and mouse ZIKV sequences did not group in the same branch with worldwide sequences including Rio de Janeiro, excluding the possibility of vector transmission and strongly favoring the mouse-to-human transmission. This is the first case of accidental ZIKV transmission through an animal bite from an experimentally infected mouse to a human with the subsequent clinical development of Zika fever and virus recovery from plasma during the acute phase. There are published reports indicating that ZIKV can be detected in saliva and this case opens the possibility of ZIKV transmission through this body fluid. However, it remains to be determined if the accidental infection was caused by infectious particles in the saliva or associated with infected blood cells.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The authors state that this case reinforces the importance of biosafety practices in the management and manipulation of ZIKV-infected animals.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: No medical intervention was provided.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: meningococcal research laboratory

Device or equipment involved: Biosafety cabinet was not used for plating.

Procedure being performed: Plating N. meningitides serogroup A in the research laboratory

How LAI / exposure occurred: Patient reported plating N. meningitides serogroup A in the research laboratory and admitted that this was not conducted under a biosafety cabinet.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: The paper recommends: BSL-2 practices including the use of a biosafety cabinet when manipulating samples that have a high potential for droplet or aerosol production.; vaccination with the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine or quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine; PCR for meningococcal serogroup determination; Real-time PCR to enhance sensitivity in diagnosis and for detection of penicillin resistance; treatment of laboratory workers with percutaneous exposure with penicillin and with mucosal exposure with chemoprophylaxis

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The paper primarily cites vaccination and use of the biosafety cabinet as available safety procedures and practices that were not followed by the summer student. The student told their laboratory supervisor that they were immunized; however, on hospital admission, admitted that this was not the case. It is not mentioned in the paper, however, a required consult with an occupational health provider to discuss vaccination may have prevented this LAI.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Patient was started on antibiotic coverage for bacterial meningitis with ceftriaxone and vancomycin and required external ventricular drain placement for intracranial pressure reduction. On hospital day two, PCR was reactive for N. meningitides serogroup A and patient was put on a 10 day course of antibiotics with intravenous penicillin, and rifampin was given to eradicate nasopharyngeal colonization.

Device or equipment involved: Case 1: bifurcated needle; Case 2: needle; Cases 3 & 4:unknown

Procedure being performed: Case 1: The incident occurred during in vitro inoculation of human skin cells Case 2: recapping a needle after inoculating a mouse with ZIKV Uganda MR766 at 107 PFU/mL Case 3: no recollection of specific event Case 4: investigation did not identify any specific exposure or reported breach in biosafety procedures, and no sharps were used in the laboratory.

How LAI / exposure occurred: Case 1: needlestick injury with a bifurcated needle PPE used: double nitrile gloves Equipment used: BSC Case 2: needlestick injury while recapping a needle after inoculating a mouse with ZIKV Uganda MR766 at 107 PFU/mL PPE used: double nitrile gloves Equipment used: BSC Case 3: No specific event was reported. The laboratorian typically worked with large quantities (4–100 L). Laboratory activities included clarifying Zika virus materials through filters, performing pump-driven chromatography, using buffers to dilute concentrated Zika virus, and adding formaldehyde to initiate Zika virus inactivation. Within the 12 day period before the onset of symptoms, the laboratorian recalled a drop of virus culture fell on the glove. The glove was removed immediately but the laboratorian thought he could have rubbed his face with the back of his hand. PPE used: first PPE layer, donned in an external area, of disposable laboratory coat or coverall, booties, a hairnet, goggles, and 1 pair of gloves, and a second PPE layer of a second coverall, hairnet, pair of gloves, and disposable face shield donned once inside the laboratory; no mask was used. Equipment used: Most procedures were done inside the BSC. Some procedures, with potential for splash were done outside the BSC Case 4: Laboratory activities sometimes involved working with the Zika virus, including performing serum neutralization testing. PPE used: gloves- detailed PPE information was unavailable Equipment used: Unknown

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Lab coat, Single pair of protective gloves, Double pair of protective gloves, Other PPE, Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Biological safety cabinet,

Follow-up procedures taken: Case 1: used a surgical sponge and chlorohexidine to scrub the wound for 15 minutes, then washed her hands with soap and water Case 2: researcher felt the stick from the needle on the left middle finger but did not see any blood. Immediately, the researcher removed gloves, washed hands with soap and water, and applied alcohol. Case 3: Contaminated glove was removed after realizing that a drop of the live virus had fallen on the glove Case 4: unknown

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: -The Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) 5th edition recommends BSL2 and ABSL2 for in vitro and in vivo work with Zika Virus, respectively. Risk assessment should be performed for activities involving a high concentration of virus, which may justify increasing the biosafety containment to BSL3. -Practices and PPE need to be adjusted when working outside a biosafety cabinet to protect against aerosol or droplet transfer of infectious material. -Personnel should have appropriate training regarding precautions to prevent exposures associated with the tasks they perform. -Careful handling of sharps includes, for example, avoiding actions that involve manipulation by hand before disposal, including bending, recapping, or removing from the syringe. Additional measures to mitigate the consequence of a lab-acquired infection include procedures for initial wound management or mucosal exposure, timely reporting, appropriate evaluation, and management of occupational Zika virus exposures.

Procedure being performed: infectious samples processing: human blood culture specimen, bacterial staining and culture; animal sample processing

How LAI / exposure occurred: The potential routes of infections included direct contact (2 cases), aerosol transmission (2 cases), and both (28 cases) (Fig. 1). All LAIs occurred due to improper operations (for example not using biological safety cabinets, not wearing a mask or wearing improperly, failing to quarantine experimental animals as required, etc.), inadequate biosafety training, and substandard laboratory safety conditions. All LAI cases comprising the seven technicians could be attributed to the lack of a biosafety management system. In a report, a pregnant technician did not process a Brucella specimen in a biosafety cabinet, leading to infection 6months later. She was also the source of a secondary case (her infant) through direct contact. Another event reflected poor supervision and management in a hospital. In April 2011, a technician (A) of Suzhou hospital (Jiangsu) processed a blood culture specimen from a patient in the general laboratory, and later, it was confirmed that the patient was infected with Brucella. However, the relevant departments of the hospital neither paid due attention to the incident nor did they initiate emergency procedures after exposure, resulting in LAI in the technician in February 2012. laboratory worker in Hangzhou hospital cultured the specimens of patients (with suspected brucellosis) at an open laboratory bench and did not adhere to the biosafety procedure and PPE, resulting in occupational exposure. The aforementioned incidents of LAIs were related to a lack of biosafety awareness, such as incorrectly wearing protective equipment and not working in the biosafety cabinet.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: The relevant departments of the hospital did not fully understand the risks associated with Brucella and did not take effective protective measures in a timely manner, which led to occupational exposure and infections .

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Biosafety training should be implemented, especially regarding the correct use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and understanding the importance of emergency response plans for potential laboratory exposures and LAIs. In addition, housekeeping staff in the clinical laboratories or research laboratories should be trained to prevent accidental exposure or infection.

Device or equipment involved: Unknown

Procedure being performed: Culturing

How LAI / exposure occurred: A 4 year old patient presented at the Health Sciences Centre at University of Manitoba (Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada) for fever, right inguinal swelling, and dysuria. The patient lived in a rural area and had a history of playing with cats and dogs and often returned home with ticks embedded in her skin. Upon examination, an ulcer was identified in the genital areas and a swab was collected for identification. The culture revealed pinpoint growth of Francisella tularensis on chocolate agar, identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Further speciation was confirmed by the NML. The laboratory technologist manipulated the sample outside the BSC because a pathogen requiring BSL3 containment was not suspected resulting in exposure. A 60 year old patient arrived at Brandon Regional Health Centre (Brandon, Manitoba, Canada) with acute onset of hypotension and an ulcer on her genital area. The patient lived in a rural area and had found a tick attached to her abdomen approx. 1 week before admission. The sample collected for identification was manipulated outside the BSC , resulting in the exposure of 1 technologist. F. tularensis was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Further speciation was confirmed by the NML.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: The exposure of the second laboratory technologist was reported to the medical health officer.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The authors state that F. tularensis infections presented as lessions in the perigenital area, thus swabs from these areas are generally not suspected to be especially hazardous as blood or lymph node or bone marrow samples would be. The other risk factor to be considered is that the patients were from rural areas and the potential for tick bites (arthropod exposure). A post-exposure alert is observing pinpoint colonies of gram-negative coccobacilli growing aerobically on chocolate agar 48 hours after plating, this may indicate the presence of F. tularensis and should prompt BSL-3 precautions (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Laboratory Response Network in affiliation with the American Society for Microbiology).

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Technologists received doxycycline for 14 days as prophylaxis and had no signs or symptoms of infection.

Procedure being performed: "handling virus"

How LAI / exposure occurred: The only information about LAI is: "One clinical laboratory-acquired infection( with fever, headache, muscle pains and seroconversion) has been mentioned in a research worker handling this virus. D. H.L bishop and J. Casals, personal communication)." The author also refers to a subclinical infection mentioned in SALS - see Am J Trp. Med Hyg 29:1359-1381. But the focus of this article is as follows: Cross protection studies between Junin and Tacaribe viruses were performed in the marmoset model, Callithrix bacchus. The marmoset C. bacchus is known to be highly susceptible to Junin virus but failed to exhibit any clinical symptoms, viremia, or hematological alterations, when infected with Tacaribe virus. Tacaribe-infected marmosets that were subsequently challenged with Junin virus were fully protected in contrast to controls that had not received the Tacaribe virus infection. These data suggest that cross protection against Argentine hemorrhagic fever or more broad protection against Arenaviruses may be possible using Tacaribe virus as a vaccine. The data also suggest that the marmoset is a good animal model for Arenaviridae vaccine research and development.

Procedure being performed: The researcher was producing replication defective pseudo viruses,

How LAI / exposure occurred: For 6 months, the individual worked in a Level 2 lab, with no access to the BL3, producing non-replication competent pseudo viruses "using HIV-1 defective expression constructs and autologous/heterologous envelope encoding plasmids - HIV-1 env, for example, or VSV-g. To quote the case report: :No major or minor laboratory accidents(perrcutaneous injury, medium splash, breaking of gloves, eye or skin contact with cell-derived medium, etc.) were recalled." 293T cells with transfected with "HIV NL4-3 env/nef defective, green fluorescent protein'abeled vector, and JFRL Env- or VSV-G plasmid." The authors state that the researcher was infected by the inadvertent, undetected contaminant of a replication-competent recombinant clone. The authors speculate that i"inapparent droplets" might have been the route of transmission, since VSV-g is pantropic.

Follow-up procedures taken: With the infected individual's permission, the course of this researchers' infection was analyzed using full-genome sequences and a number of other analyses to warn others of the hazard of working in laboratories where multiple HIV-derived constructs are handled. The virus isolated from the researcher showed a high homology with the constructs handled, particularly the JFRL.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The authors state that the infection is likely due to "unaware use" of an infectious clone due to contamination or a labeling error, and, in the conclusion, reminds us that BL2 labs are often "large spaces occupied by many laboratory personnel working on different lists of projects (also conducted in BSL3) and sharing laboratory equipment." The authors recommend stricter control of procedures and risk assessments of every experiment.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: The individual received antiviral therapy 36 months after diagnosis when cD4 cell counts and plasma HIV RNA met the guidelines in place at that time for initiative of antiretroviral drugs. After 10 weeks of therapy, the infection was considered suppressed and this status is maintained at the time of publication

Biological Safety Level (BSL) for work being performed?: BSL-2

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Research laboratory

Device or equipment involved: plate spreader, plate scraper, flaming loops, pipettor,

Procedure being performed: performing culture procedures on the open laboratory bench

How LAI / exposure occurred: Multiple breaches in recommended laboratory safety practices were identified as common practice in this laboratory. These include the manipulation of N. meningitides isolates on the open laboratory bench. This un-safe practice can result in aerosol transmission of the bacteria. It is presumed this is how the LAI occurred. It was also noted that laboratory personnel lacked adequate safety training.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Lab coat, Single pair of protective gloves, Other PPE,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure:

Follow-up procedures taken: Follow-up procedures RECOMMENDED (but not necessarily taken): - Perform all open manipulation of infectious material inside a biosafety cabinet (BSC).This includes plate spreading, inoculation of media, and re-suspension of solution, to name a few. - Replace open flames (for transfer loops) with disposable transfer loops used in a BSC. - dispose of waste generated in the BSC in a bag or container within the BSC. The waste bag/container should be sealed and wiped down before removing it from the BSC and transferring it into the biohazardous bin outside the BSC. - Follow BSL-2+ practices including: - Use disposable closed-front laboratory coats. - Double glove: removing the outer-layer inside the BSC - Wear wrap-around eye protection, goggles, or face shield - Wear a fit-tested N95 respirator, particularly when culturing large volumes. - Employer should ensure laboratory staff are trained and adhere to biosafety practices - Laboratory staff should be offered recommended vaccines.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The actions taken by the patient to prevent exposure were minimal: - wearing a cloth lab coat - wearing a single layer of gloves

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: The patient was suspected of having meningococcal disease and was treated at the hospital with ceftriaxone. He died approximately 3 hours after arrival (approximately 17 hours after the first onset of symptoms).

Biological Safety Level (BSL) for work being performed?: -none-

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: vaccine plant

Device or equipment involved: not described

Procedure being performed: dried powder was packaged into glass bottles

How LAI / exposure occurred: Some bottles broke during the packing of freeze-dried neurotropic African Horsesickness Virus,(AFV) resulting in release of aerosolized virus. The AFV was a veterinary vaccine strain. The authors assume the route of transmission was intranasal, because of the predominant temporal lobe involvement in the encephalitis cases. 3 of the 4 workers had encephalitis, and all 4 had uveochorioretinitis. All 4 had neutralizing antibodies to AFV serotypes 1 and 6. In addition, 5 of the 15 healthy workers at the plant also had neutralizing antibodies to AFV, but not to serotypes 1 and 6. The authors state that these cases are "possibly the first report of subclinical and clinical neurotropic AHS infections in man".

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: The first encephalitis case was investigated as a possible LAI, but not cause was found,. A second case prompted further review, and two more cases were identified. Companion papers present more clinical details: II. Reid et.al. Part II-Opthamological findings. SAMJ 1992 vol 81:454-458. III. Swanepoel et. al. Virological and Serological investigations.

Biological Safety Level (BSL) for work being performed?: -none-

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: stairway, hallway, and laboratory

Device or equipment involved: glass ampules, homogenizer

Procedure being performed: transport of vials, homogenization of mouse brains

How LAI / exposure occurred: 1) One incident infected 22 staff. Several ampules of high-titer lyophilized brain suspension from VEE infected mice were dropped on the staircase. The airflow drew the aerosol down a 30 meter corridor, infecting 17 staff who walked down the corridor and the 5 who disinfected the spill. Two individuals "upwind" of the spill, but closer to it, were not infected. 2) A laboratory assistant was infected when homogenizing mouse brains, as well as 3 others in the same room who were not wearing face shields. 3) Eight other laboratory acquired infections with VEE at different times between 1969 and 1975, but details of the exposures are not known.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: All received medical care,; details of the infection and convalesce are provided. The incubation period before onset of disease was 28 hours (one case), 50 hours (19 cases) and approximately 3 days ( 2 cases). One LAI was a pregnant woman infected in her 8th montb of pregnancy who gave birth to a healthy child. All recovered completely. Serological monitoring indicated specific antibodies to VEE after recovery for up to 23 years.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: 1) Gasketed, aerosol-proof secondary container for transport. 2) Contained homogenization equipment. Since this is an aerosol-transmitted virus, respiratory protection would be an important second line of defense. The usual PPE in use in the laboratory was a double medical gown, cap, face shield, rubber gloves, and boots.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: No post-exposure prophylaxis; symptoms were treated. . It was noted that, despite the presence of virus in the throat, the LAI were not coughing and did not have rhinitis. The authors assumed that this prevented transmission to household members.

Device or equipment involved: unknown

Procedure being performed: unknown

How LAI / exposure occurred: All victims worked for one of several plants manufacturing vaccine against bovine brucellosis. Of the 30 cases, nine recalled exposure of varying types. "Individuals were questioned about the nature of their job, especially regarding actual or potential contact with the S19 strain. An accidental exposure was defined as an inhaled spray, a splash into the eyes or broken skin, or a skin cut while handling the S19 vaccine. As a control, Subjects were also questioned about potential exposure to field strains of Brucella (ingestion of unpasteurized milk or cheese, contact with infected animals, etc.)....Accidental exposure was reported by nine (30%) laboratory employees. Exposures recalled were percutaneous in six cases, inhalators in three and conjunctival in one (more than one route in one case)." The tone of the article suggests that vaccine strain Brucella abortus S19 was not expected to cause clinical symptoms in exposed personnel. Other Brucella vaccines strains are also pathogenic - Brucella abortus strain RB51 and B. melitensus strain Rev-1. This claims to be the first report of S19 strain causing brucellosis in vaccine production laboratory workers.

How LAI / exposure occurred: A baboon outbreak lasted 3 weeks (12 Feb to mid-March); flu-like anecdotal reports of flu-like illness in staff prompted study of serology in staff working with baboons during the outbreak. Pre-exposure titers (from 1993 samples were compared to 1997 titers; 5 out of 6 potentially exposed staff staff had titters to BaAdV-1; all 6 had titers to BaAdv-2. Note: Once respiratory symptoms developed, baboons were quarantined, Staff work disposable suits and gloves for feeding/contact with infant baboons. 6 out 6 staff developed antibody titers to 2 novel adenoviruses; the authors state that this is evidence of cross-species transmission. All of the facilities involved in necropsy, culture, nucleic acid extraction, and serum analysis were certified to BSL2.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: pathology laboratory

Device or equipment involved: compressed gas coolant

Procedure being performed: sectioning tissue frozen with compressed gas coolant

How LAI / exposure occurred: "Tissue was frozen in a cryostat, each frozen piece was then mounted inside the machine on a microtome and sectioned. In order to reduce the freezing time before mounting the tissue, the laboratory sprayed the tissue block with a compressed gas coolant held by hand outside the cryostat. Spraying was continued inside the cryostat after the block was mounted. This maneuver creates a heavy aerosol. The tissue to be sectioned was from a patient admitted to the hospital the presumptive diagnosis was lung cancer. The patient died 48 hours later, before x rays were taken.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Skin tests for TB were done on 17 clinical staff members had contact with the patient, and two pathologists and a laboratory assistant were present at the autopsy. All were negative. However, the two pathologists present during sectioning of the tissue seroconverted.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The authors state: "Masks were not worn during this procedure. Although it cannot be definitely proven, it is suspected that the aerosol promoted the transmission of infection for both pathologists. The use of spray coolant has been discontinued in the laboratory."

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: This is not stated, however, we assume the standard drug treatment for tuberculosis was offered to the pathologists.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: clinical laboratory

Device or equipment involved: open tubes of blood

Procedure being performed: disposal into box lined with plastic bag

How LAI / exposure occurred: During disposal of open blood tubes, 0.5 ml of blood splashed on the conjunctiva of the eye. The blood did not hit the mouth, and the individual did not have lesions on his face. The individual washed the eye immediately and took post-exposure prophylaxis (AXT only was used at that time within 3 hours and finished the entire prescribed therapy. Unfortunately, acute HIV infection was diagnosed at 29 days post-exposure, and Hepatitis C infection at 3 months post exposure. The authors reported that no risk factors other than the occupational exposure were identified.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Right after the splash, the individual washed the eye and reported to Occupational Health Services. Among the tubes were at least 6 samples from HIV patients at varying disease stages.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The authors recommend keeping tubes closed for disposal. Eye protection is not listed as a recommendation, but it would also seem appropriate.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: AZT alone was the standard post-exposure prophylaxis. This case prompted the authors to recommend use of the triple cocktail of antiretroviral drugs for post-exposure prophylaxis.

Procedure being performed: working with the agent in the laboratory

How LAI / exposure occurred: The exposure incident is not discussed. The agent was worked with in the laboratory,and puritic erythema occurred on the outer corner of the lower left eyelid. A topical steroid was used for 3 days, but the lesion continued to expand, so the researcher went to a dermatologist.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Treatment of the lesions occurred, and a scale from the lesion was cultured. Sensitive molecular typing and mating with tester strains indicated that it was A. benhamaiae. This 2002 publication indicated that A. benhmamaie had been isolated 5 other times in Japan, but those individuals had contracted their dermatophytic infection from contact with pets. This strain was different from those isolates, but the LAI isolate had the same restriction profile as the strain used in laboratory experiments.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The authors were recommend strain identification to find the source of an infection. Personally, I would recommend wearing a disposable face shield to protect from face contact with contaminated hands or gloves and protect from droplets.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: None. The LAI was reported 3 days after the lesion on the face appeared.

Follow-up procedures taken: A thorough review of this laboratory accident was conducted at laboratory and institution levels by a multi-disciplinary team consisting of representatives from Environmental Health & Safety/Biosafety, Occupational Health with consultation from the Infectious Disease, Research Compliance, and research & Accademic Affairs, with the participation of representative researchers. In addition, the affected employee had completed all the required training in general research safety, biosafety, animal handling, and in the use of infectious agents in animals.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Formal standard operating procedures were revised or written to address key practices. This incident prompted a review of practices and policies regarding the use of vaccinia virus in the institution´s laboratories. A reporting system for work-related incidents involving hazards was standardized with risk assessment, root cause analysis, corrective actions, and sharing lessons learned.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: First stage: Antibiotic treatment with vancomycin, then cefalozin for suspected bacterial superinfection. Second stage: Broad-spectrum antibiotics were started to cover fro bacterial cellulitis. After taking a swab for bacterial culture and demonstrated that were no growth, the broad spectrum antibiotics were discontinued.

Device or equipment involved: Unknown

Procedure being performed: Unknown

How LAI / exposure occurred: An immunosuppressed laboratory technician, who never had visited any leishmaniasis-endemic areas accidentally cut her left index finger and resulted in a percutaneous inoculation of amastigote culture forms of L. mexicana.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: L. mexicana was cultured from wound secretion aspirates. After DNA extraction and amplification by Leishmania-specific PCR, RsaI restriction revealed the non-Leishmania donovani complex pattern. In addition, physicians should be aware that long-lasting, probably lifelong parasite persistence may occur in the context of chronic granulomatous response even after clinical cure.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Physicians responsible for laboratory workers exposed to Leishmania spp. should be familiar with the epidemiology and pathogenesis of leishmaniasis in order to give appropriate individual advice.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: A 20-day treatment with local application of 15% paromomycin (aminosidine)/ 10% urea was tried wich had been found less irritating than the paromomycin/methyl-benzethonium chloride combination, followed by the simultaneous oral application of ketoconazole 400 mg daily for further 30 days. Interferon gamma therapy was not considered because of the SLE. In addition weekly intralesional injections of meglumine antimonate and daily application of a dressing soaked with meglumine antimonate resulted in clinical cure after5 weeks.

How LAI / exposure occurred: An epidemic outbreak of acute brucellosis transmitted by airborne among workers of a veterinarty laboratory during the production of a manufactured Brucella vaccine. . Airborne transmission - within the vaccine laboratory, workers manipulated Brucella vaccine (Rev-1) under a glass bell with a negative pressure. The air from these bells and from the laboratory was suctioned and expelled to the exterior through an aperture in one of the walls which opened in the main façade of the building - there is no mention that the air was filtered in any way. The vaccine was last produced in June - mean incubation of 10 weeks (range: 5 to 14 weeks). Workers returned to work after their annual four-week vacation. Employees working in areas with open windows above the laboratory air extracting system had an attack rate of 39.5%, substantially higher than those working in other locations. Factors that were statistically associated with infection were eating in the dining room and (a weaker association) drinkingwater from well number 1. The well, as a source, was ruled out.

Procedure being performed: Unknown

How LAI / exposure occurred: A patient who worked with a non-Orthopoxvirus Chorodopoxvirus (NOC), which had stocks of cowpox virus stored in a freezer. The patient had no history of smallpox vaccination. The data suggest that the patient was likely infected by handling laboratory stock virus reagents or contact with environmental surfaces which were contaminated with cowpox virus.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Wrap around gown, Single pair of protective gloves, Other PPE,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Extensive sampling, both of laboratory reagents and the environment, and complete characterization of the patient´s infection were necessary to understand the sources of infection and mitigate any further risks to the patient and others.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Complete environmental decontamination, destruction of the contaminated viral isolates, and separation of NOC and pathogenic viral stocks into clearly labeled boxes. In addition,unexplained and potential laboratory-acquired infections among laboratory workers should be promptly reported to appropriate institutional and occupational health officials, as well as, public health authorities. In case of zoonotic diseases that are not endemic to an area, prompt testing and reporting is essential to prevent further cases and to prevent the establishment of the disease in either human or animal populations. clinicians and healthcare providers should be attentive to the potential of Orthopoxvirus infection when examining patients with a vesiculo-pustular rash or lesion, especially if the patient works in a laboratory with poxviruses. In addition, vaccination is an important consideration for all the individuals at risk of exposure to an Orthopoxvirus, including cowpox.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: the patient visited a physician at the institution´s health center with a presumptive diagnosis of Mycobacterioum infection. At the begining, levofloxacin and clindamycin were used according to a differential diagnosis.

Procedure being performed: Animal (monkey) handling

How LAI / exposure occurred: Patient 1: An animal caretaker was bitten on the left thumb by a 3-y-old Rhesus monkey that was suffering from severe bilateral conjunctivitis and diarrhea. It was not certain whether he was wearing gloves when he was bitten. Patient 2: A biological technician suffered a penetrating wound which may have been a monkey bite or scratch on the left forearm. He also handled smaller animals without leather gloves, but it is uncertain whether he was wearing them at the time he was exposed. Patient 3: A laboratory supervisor was handling a clinically healthy monkey. Despite he wore leather gloves to catch the animal only surgical gloves were wored when he was holding it afterward. Patient 4: Wife of the patient 2 had applied hydrocortisone cream to her husband´s skin lesions. She also applied this cream to an area of contact dermatitis under a ring on her finger. the dermatitis was highly pruritic, and she scratched it to the point of bleeding.

Follow-up procedures taken: Patient immediately treated after the diagnosis was confirmed; however, new macrolides were not universally in use of C. pneumoniae infection at that time. Patient has been on maintenance beta 2-sympatomimetic and cortisone inhalation therapy since 2000 after asthma was diagnosed. It is believed the first exposure sensitized her so that she developed severe asthma after the first episode and whenever she had a flu-like illness or took exercise. In July 1999, she had an acute illness with severe cough, fever and asthma symptoms - chest x-ray showed an infiltrate compatible with pneumonia which disappeared after being successfully treated with clarithromycin 500mg t.i.d., cortisone and terbutaline sulphate.

Follow-up procedures taken: Affected individual had throat swabbed and blood taken eight days after onset of illness. Two consultants in communicable disease managed the incident, one for the area where the laboratory is sited, and the other for the area where the affected individual lives. Throat swabs taken from close contacts and all the other laboratory staff.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: It is already stated in the organisations SOPs (published in 1996) that it is recommended that when staff handle suspected C. diphtheriae and N. meningitidis isolates, procedures likely to generate aerosols should be carried out in a safety cabinet. It is also recommended by another Government publication that people who may be exposed to diphtheria in the course of their work be fully immunised and their levels of antibody tested at least three months after completion of immunisation. Booster doses should be given at intervals of 10 years.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Affected individual treated with penicillin for two weeks and a second throat swab taken after completion (negative). A booster dose of diphtheria toxoid was given to all laboratory staff.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Veterinary school teaching clinic

Device or equipment involved: Unknown

Procedure being performed: Exam and treatment of bull presenting with anorexia, weight loss, and intractable diarrhea

How LAI / exposure occurred: The students and faculty members put their hands in the mouth of a 2 year old Brahman bull during exam and treatment. Bull presented with anorexia, weight loss, and intractable diarrhea. During the next 5-18 days 5 of the 6 individuals developed papules on their hands. The papules progressed to annular red and gray lesions on fingers and hands.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Bovine popular stomatitis virus was isolated from lesions in 2 individuals. Later interviews with 3 of the 5 individuals who developed lesions indicated that these individuals recalled having wounds on their hands during exposure to the bull and that the lesions developed in the approximate sites of the wounds. Of note, 1 other faculty member and 11 other students working in the same ward who didn't have physical contact with the bull did not develop lesions.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: While the exact PPE used in the clinic is unknown one may presume that use of gloves, sleeves, laboratory coat, coverall suit or other uniform might have prevented exposure. In addition, education of personnel regarding the risk of exposure posed by broken skin might have prompted personnel to don PPE and take care with hand washing procedures.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Infectious disease laboratory

Device or equipment involved: Probe type cell disruptor

Procedure being performed: Cell disruption

How LAI / exposure occurred: Two individuals working in an infetious disease laboratory reported illnesses about 4-6 weeks after doing thir work in lab. The sonications were repeatedly carried out by personnel using a Heat systems Ultrasonics probe type cell disruption in an open test tube in the corridor outside the biocontainment suite rooms. Undoubtedly, inhalation of aerosols generated by the sonication process led to seroconversion of personnel to Chlamydia polypeptides and ultimately resulted in the illnesses described below. The illness in one individual was characterized by a daily fever, malaise, night sweats, and a weight loss. Chest radiograph and a CBC revealed an elevated white count and an enlarged mediastinal lymph node. The other individual showed the same symptoms of fever and malaise, but not as dramatic a white blood cell count, and her radiograph was normal. She did, however, have splenomegaly.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Biological safety cabinet, Other engineering control,

Follow-up procedures taken: At the time of the report of the illnesses the Biosafety Office was informed of the incident and a full investigation was initiated.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Since a mutual understanding had been reached that personnel would employ all the safeguards and procedures under the biosafety level 2 guidelines or P2, and the group had been working in a fully air-balanced P3 facility for their projects, a thorough inspection was made of the facility, its ventilation system, biosafety cabinets, and laboratory procedures. The ventilation system and safety cabinets had been certified only four months prior to the incident. These incidents have resulted in more frequent laboratory inspections and review of procedures and safeguards by the BioSafety Office.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Once that immunoassays revealed a striking seroconversion to Chlamydia, a regimen of doxycicline was started.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Research laboratory

Device or equipment involved: Unknown

Procedure being performed: Microimmunofluorescence (micro-IF) test

How LAI / exposure occurred: The present study describes serological, clinical and radiological findings in four cases: two laboratory- and two community acquired lower respiratory tract infections. Case 1: Female laboratory technician had been working with herpex simplex, measles and mumps viruses while other technicians in this laboratory were studying the L2 (434 bu) serovar of C. trachomatis. She became ill, presenting with headache and intermittent fever. On physical examination, there were no signs of respiratory distress, no lymphadenopathy, and no pathological findings on auscultation of the lungs. One week later, she presented with a temperature of 39 C, anorexia, a 3-kg weight loss, malaise, marked weakness, headache and a dry cough with pleuritic chest pain. A chest X-ray revealed an alveolar infiltrate in the right lower lobe without pleural effusion. Case 2: Female laboratory technician working at the same laboratory as Case 1, had had direct contact with LGV-L2 (434 bu). One month after the onset of illness of Patient 1, she started complaining of intermittent fever, malaise and a dry cough. On physical examination, there were no signs of respiratory distress, lymphadenopathy or ocular or genital infection. She had mild pharyngitis, and lung auscultation was normal. Five days later, her temperature rose to 30 C, and there was exacerbation of the dry cough and malaise, but there were still no findings on lung auscultation and no shortness of breath. Case 2 was aware of the Case 1, one month earlier, and therefore underwent serological test for C. trachomatis by IPA and micro-IF.

Procedure being performed: cat stomach dissection

How LAI / exposure occurred: Officially unknown; however: The laboratory worker "opened and manipulated" the cat stomach. After his symptoms started he was observed dissecting a cat stomach in a tissue bath. The tissue bath contained a "bubbling device". The laboratory worker worked close enough to the tissue that the "bubbling device" spattered a mist onto his glasses and face. The laboratory worker did not wear gloves or a mask while handling the opened cat stomach. The assumption is that he ingested the organism.

Biological Safety Level (BSL) for work being performed?: BSL-1

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: it sounds like this was a clinical laboratory.

Device or equipment involved: 8. Case 1: an automated identification system, and vortex. Case 2: vortex. Case 3: did not used any equipment, only manipulation of culture. Case 4: none reported.

Procedure being performed: 9. Case1: This worker was responsible for identification of the isolates. She used an automated identification system and performed slide latex agglutination. Vortexing was also done on the bench top and phone was answered with and without gloves being worn. Case2: The worker made suspension of E.coli O157:H7 with a swab and vortexed the tube. Case:3 The worker made a subculture only. Case4: The worker performed a latex agglutination test to identify the strain

How LAI / exposure occurred: 10. Case 1: Most likely because the laboratory phone was answered both with and without gloves being worn and the lab coat was never buttoned. In addition, hands were not washed each time the gloves were removed. Case 2: Even though PPE was properly worn and removed, hands washed each time, LAI could have been due to aerosols formation due to vortexing on the bench top. Case 3: Two workers manipulated the same isolate throughout the same time period. One was using computer and turning faucet handles while wearing gloves (did not get sick). Both workers did not wash their hands often. The infected person did not wear gloves. Case 4: The worker wore gloves while answering phone and using computer.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Lab coat, Single pair of protective gloves,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: An interview was done in each case to discuss the rout of infection, but no other details were provided.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Phones and computer should be used only after gloves are removed and hands washed. Vortexing should be done in BSC and not on the bench top as any other method involving handling the culture (a latex agglutination).

The second case: The only information disclosed is that the student was in close contact with the animals that were concurrently infected with Salmonella typhimurium and Cryptosporidium. It has been suggested that the close proximity of the student to the animals makes the animal to man transmission likeable cause.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: In the first case it is not reported. In the second case: five days after initial contact with the animals, the student started experiencing the first symptoms: nausea, followed by diarrhea and fever. The other symptoms came such as headache. Prochlorperazine was given to the students to control nausea and nutrition was taken in liquid form. The clinical course was 11 days.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: First case: not reported but proper washing and disinfection of infected materials (such as bedding) Second case: not reported but the student was probably not wearing proper PPE.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: First case: not reported Second case: the student was given plenty of nutrients in liquid form and prochlorperazine to control nausea.

How LAI / exposure occurred: This is a review of LAI data from 77 tuberculosis labs in Germany, Austria and Switzerland concerned with mycobacterial infection. Infections were defined according to regulations for reporting occupational diseases - 88 infections were reported over 3349 person-years. This equates to 2.63 infections per 100 person-years which is a frequency approx. 100 times higher than that in the general population. Risk factors include: frequency of infection and the number of positive samples isolated, laboratories that rotate staff, use of radiometric diagnostic technique plus also needle-stick. Those labs that did not use a BSC had an infection rate of 2.63 per 100 person-years (52 labs and 36 cases; 1830 person-years), Class I BSC had an infection rate of 1.90 per 100 person-years (13 labs and 5 cases; 263 person-years) and Class II BSC had an infection rate of 2.44 per 100 person-years (54 labs and 26 cases; 1016 person-years).

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: microbiology teaching lab

Device or equipment involved: unknown

Procedure being performed: Students were conducting an exercise - identification of strains in "mystery broth". Identification of "unknowns" is a standard micro lab exercise.

How LAI / exposure occurred: Due to safety concerns, the lab had not, for a few years, intentionally used Salmonella typhimurium. However, the Maryland Department of Health matched two cases of Salmonella by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis during the 2011 teaching lab outbreak. A third case, from 2010, with a matching isolate was also identified. The source was traced back to a culture erroneously labeled Citrobacter.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: The teaching laboratory removed all organisms requiring Biosafety Level 2 practices from the "mystery broth: exercise.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Following the CDC advice issues in 2011 would have prevented the exposures. The CDC poster "What You Work with Can Make YOU Sick" available for dowloading on the Salmonella website emphasizes standard good laboratory practice: lab coat, gloves, washing hands after glove removal, leaving pens in the lab, not touching personal devices such as cell phones, etc.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Medical attention must have been required.

The manufacturers instructions at that time did not include an instruction to use a safety (UK Class I) cabinet, but this was already recommended practice for such procedures. For those who are working infrequently with meningococcal cultures in district microbiology laboratories, conjugated meningococcal C vaccine with expected long-term protection after a single dose may be considered. For those who are regularly exposed to meningococcal cultures in research or reference laboratories, bivalent or quadrivalent polysaccharide vaccines and outer membrane protein vaccines should also be considered, depending on risk of exposure, efficacy of available vaccines and the strains with wich they are working.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Unknown. However in the rare incidents when a high risk of exposure to aerosols of N. meningitidis is reported, antibiotic prophylaxis with rifampicin or ciprofloxacin should be offered promplty.

Device or equipment involved: Unknonw

Procedure being performed: Characterization of N. gonorrhoeae strain

How LAI / exposure occurred: A male technician reported needlestick injury acquired three days ago while he was working on characteriation of N. gonorrhoeae strain isolated from patient with urethritis. The injury happened on Friday, at the end of the working process in diagnostic laboratory. At the moment of the exposure, he was wearing gloves, however, needle pierced the glove and stubbed to the skin of his left hand index finger. Immediately upon the injury he went to the sink and thoroughly washed the wound while vigorously squeezing the finger to express as much blood as he could. In addition, the wound was disinfected with 70% ethanol.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Single pair of protective gloves,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Incision was performed the day after receiving the first dose of azithromycin. Surgical incision and drainage is the definitive treatment of a soft tissue abscess. Antibiotics alone are ineffective in the face of a localized collection of pus. Combnination of surgical incision and antibiotic therapy resulted in faster and complete recovery.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Treatment of gonococcal abscess requires evacuation and drainage of the pus accompained with approrpiate antibiotic therapy.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Oral antibiotic therapy with azithromycin (500 mg daily over three days) was immediately started.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Clinical microbiology laboratory

Device or equipment involved: Unknown

Procedure being performed: Identification of an unknown pathogen

How LAI / exposure occurred: A 719-bed university affiliated hospital microbiology laboratory employs 19 medical technologists and processes 137,000 specimens per year. Three medical students were also working in the laboratory. Between 23 and 28 January 1996, 6 of the 19 medical technologists but none of the 3 medical technology students developed diarrhea. Transmission appears to have resulted from contamination of the faucet handles of the single sink used for hand washing by technologists in the work area. The student working with the unknown isolate admitted that heavy glove contamination had occurred when he placed his gloved finger in a titer well containing a high concentration of the pathogen during the typing process.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Control measures included a mandatory leave of absence for each affected technologist until resolution of diarrhea, the use of a phenolic agent to clean environmental surfaces in the work area of the laboratory.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Educating laboratory personnel about transmissio of enteric pathogens, and, based on the case control study findings, the benefit of using paper towels over faucet handles as barriers until the sink could be refitted with an infrared-activated faucet, and the institution of a new policy stating that students were not to be given a Shigella isolate as an unknown to identify. Since the implementation of these interventions, no further laboratory-acquired cases of shigellosis have been documented. Among the six technologists, the total time lost from work was 73 days (range, 1 to 54 days), representing approximately $10,000 in wage value. In addition, this report emphasizes the fact that despite the rigorous training of students and new personnel, close supervision of these individuals is of paramount importance. Design of sinks in clinical microbiology laboratories is not mentioned in some recent texts dealing with optimal design requirements.

Device or equipment involved: Unknown

Procedure being performed: Case 1: Handling of fecal specimen ; Case 2: Performing of the Sereny test of pathogenicity

How LAI / exposure occurred: This paper describes infections in a family due to S. boydii 4 and an atypical aerogenic strain of S. boydii 14 wich were followed by two infections of trained laboratory personnel in different bacteriological institutes. When stool cultures of the family were performed at the Department of Medical Microbiology, Medical Faculty University of Aachen, a laboratory technician who had handled the material developed abdominal cramps and back pain with watery diarrhea. A second laboratory infection ocurred in a technician at the Natinoal Reference Centre for Salmonella, Institute of Hygiene Hamburg, who fell sick with abdominal cramps, watery and bloody diarrhea, and fever about 2 1/2 days after having performed the pathogenicity test (Sereny test) with one of the isolates.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Rectal swabs and stool specimens of the infected laboratory technician and his family were cultured at 37° on Mac-Conkey and Salmonella-Shigella agar. Enrichment cultures were performed in selenite and grammnegative broth (Hajna) with subsequent culture on the above mentioned solid media. Suspected colonies were tested by biochemical and serological reactions.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Atypical strains of bacterial species frequently cause difficulties in diagnosis. Due to the distinct gas formation even on Kligler´s iron agar the described Shigella variant might easily escape primary identification. The possibility of the importation of new pathogenic agents by travellers has increased considerably and should stimulate the awareness of bacteriologists in their daily routine work.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Field study

Device or equipment involved: Power tools

Procedure being performed: Necropsy

How LAI / exposure occurred: This article presents a case of primary pneumonic plague in a biologist who was found deceased in his residence 1 week after conducting a necropsy on a mountain lion. The biologist conducted the necropsy in his garage without the use of personal protective equipment.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: To determine cause of death, a postmortem examination was conducted and friends and colleagues were interviewed. Phisical evidence was reviewed, including specimens from the mountain lion and the biologist´s medical chart, camera and computer. Human and animal tissues were submitted for testing. Persons in close contact (within 2 meters) to the biologist after he had developed symptoms were identified and offered chemoprophylaxis.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Enhanced awareness of zoonotic diseases and appropriate use of personal protective equipment are needed for biologists and other who handle wildlife. In response to this case, the National Park Service has issued Service-wide guidelines for safe handling of wildlife, including recommendations on the appropriate use of personal protective equipment as guided by the local prevalence of disease, potential routes of transmission, and the relative risk of species-specific activities. Protocols and policies, including active managerial oversight, for necropsies and other work conducted by biologists are also being developed.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: The patient decesed on November 2, 2007. The biologist died of primary pneumonic plague acquired through the inhalation of aerosols generated while handling an infected mountain lion. Forty-nine persons received chemoprophylaxis (doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, and cotrimoxazole), including 11 emergency responders, 10 work colleagues, 8 clinic personnel, and 3 residential/social contacts. No contacts developed symptoms consistent with pneumonic plague during the typical 2-4 day incubation period.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Because of the rapidly progressive, additive polyarthritis, tenosynovitis, rash, and fever, a presumptive diagnosis of neisserial arthritis-dermatitis syndrome was made and she was treated with penicillin G potassium, 2 million units intravenously (IV) every four hours. Once that the microorganisms was identified as S. enteritidis, therapy was changed to ampicillin sodium, 1.5 g IV every four hours. Because of continued peripheral leukocytosis and recurrent accumulation of purulent fluid in joints, she was treated with ampicillin IV for eight full days, and thereupon switched to chloramphenicol, 750 mg orally every six hours, because a pruritic rash developed secondary to ampicillin. Chloramphenicol therapy was discontinued 16 days after discharge, for a total antibiotic treatment period of 30 days.

Procedure being performed: identification of abscess cultures

How LAI / exposure occurred: The likely exposure occurred during the typical work up of a clinical abscess. Gram stain, subcultures, and biochemical identifications were conducted on the open bench. 1 individual reported sniffing a culture. The cultures were initially mis-identified as Moraxella phenylpyruvica but the reference lab identified Brucella melitensis 22 days later.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: 26 individuals were potentially exposed via aerosols. 19 were present in the room during the exposure, 1 person who sniffed an agar plate on one occasion and 6 technologists that directly handled the cultures. The 19 who did not directly handle cultures and the 1 person that sniffed the agar plate one time were grouped as lower risk and treated only if clinical signs of disease presented or if they sero-converted. The other 6 were offered prophylactic antibiotics and 1 declined. Serological screening was performed initially and bi-weekly but compliance was poor.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Handling open cultures in a BSC and not "sniffing" cultures.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: High risk individuals were offered doxycycline at 100mg po twice daily and rifampin at 600 mg po qd for 3 weeks A pregnant worker received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole at 160mg/800mg bid for 3 weeks The individual that declined prophylaxis was given doxycyline 100mg bid for 6 weeks and gentamicin 120mg im qd for 3 weeks after she developed clinical disease.

How LAI / exposure occurred: No particular event could be identified. Authors speculate that contact with a contaminated surface, piece of equipment, or object. The individual had been trained on the risks of working with vaccinia, but were unaware of the signs of vaccinia infection and did not realize they were infected. The hospitalization was originally for what was thought to be a secondary bacterial infection. A second case described in the article involved work with genetically modified vaccinia. A postgraduate student was admitted to the hospital with a infection in an eyebrow piercing and a finger, and was being treated for a suspected bacterial infection since he the student had a high fever, severe inflammatation swelling of the face. A colleague considered the finger lesion indicate of vaccinia infected and alerted the medical staff. The LAI was confirmed serologically. The postgraduate student had been inoculating mice with vaccinia; it was considered likely that the eyebrow piercing was infected from the finger lesion.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: The individual was hospitalized and an investigation was initiated in September of 2002.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Adding symptom recognition to training is indirectly advised. It is also stated the WR strain with the thymidine kinase deletion is often used in laboratories since it grows to high titer. Although that strain is less virulent in mice, the article reminds us that it causes human infection. It is also noted that the vaccine strains Wyeth and Lister are capable of infection.

Device or equipment involved: unknown and needlestick

Procedure being performed: horse necropsy and unknown

How LAI / exposure occurred: The veterinary student was performing a necropsy on a foal that was euthanized due to West Nile virus. The brain and spinal cord were removed. The student was one of three people performing the necropsy. The laboratorian was working on an undescribed project, and received a needle stick.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Other PPE,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: The veterinary student was treated symptomatically once symptoms appeared. The laboratory worker had blood drawn immediately after the needlestick, and was treated symptomatically once symptoms appeared. She had received the yellow fever virus prior to the needlestick, and still developed neurological disease, which contradicts previous information that the yellow fever vaccine may protect patients from WNV.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The only PPE worn by the veterinary student was gloves. Following this incident, additional PPE is now worn during necropsies at this facility. No information about PPE or other actions is given for the laboratory worker.

Follow-up procedures taken: Blood plasma, saliva and urine were obtained from four humans and nine chimpanzees persistently infected with chimpanzee-type SFV for an unknown lenght of time. SFV-specific immunoglobulin G antibodies, but not IgA antibodies, against the Gag and Bet proteins were detected, by Western blotting, in all sample types from infected humans and chimanzees. This is the first report comparing the presence and type of antibodies in plasma and mucosal secretions from occupationally SFV-infected humans and naturally infected chimpanzees.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Further mechanisms of transmission in humans differ substantially from those of chimpanzees that involve biting, scratching, and fighting behaviors. In addition, the results from this study provide an initial comparison of host mucosal humoral immunity and SFV-host interactions in humans and chimpanzees. Further study of SFV-specific host mucosal immunity is necessary to determine the contribution to viral persistence in the infected host and differences in transmission between chimpanzees and humans.

How LAI / exposure occurred: Case 1: One man who had been bitten 10 years earlier by a mandrill and another bitten 22 years earlier by a macaque were found to be SFV infected, both at the Primate Centre. The first person was bitten by a chimpanzee on a finger in 1996 and by a mandrill on a shoulder during the same year. Case 2: The second man recalled a bite on a finger by an unknown monkey in 1985 and had a sequence close to the SFVmac sequences. Comparative sequence analysis of the virus form the first man and from the mandrill showed nearly identical sequences, indicating genetic stability of SFV over time.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: SFV infection was determined by specific serological (Western blot) and molecular (nested PCR of the integrase region in the polymerase gene) assays. Seropositivity for SFV was found in 70/84 (83%) captive and 9/15 (60%) wild-caught madrills and in 2/20 (10%) humans. SFV sequences were obtained from amplified 425-bp integrase fragments in PBMC DNA from the two SFV seropositive persons as well as from the chimpanzee and the mandrill. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the viruses were almost identical, with only one base difference (99.7% nucleotide identitity).

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: This report shows a high prevalence of SFV infection in a semi-free-ranging colony of mandrills, with the presence of two different strains. In addition, it shows the transmission of SFV from mandrill and macaque to humans.

How LAI / exposure occurred: This is a retrospective study covering the period of pre-1970 to 1999. Over 1200 medical workers sampled via postal survey, 628 replies were received which identified 75 cases of brucellosis in the laboratory workers.. Exposure was presumed during isolation or culture of organism 75. BSL3 is required in Spain when working with materials suspected to contain Brucella sp. Over 80 % of the 75 LAI identified a failure in biosafety practices occurring during work with organisms/sample. The most significant factor associated with the likelihood of infection was the total number of positive isolates per year by that particular facility.

How LAI / exposure occurred: Hospital worker was involved in isolation of B. melintensis in Nov. 1980 and became ill in Jan 1982 with "flu-like" illness. Subject became pregnant subsequent to the illness and later suffered injury to the fetus following a fall. Pregnancy was terminated and culture of material blood and placenta cultured B. melitensis. B. melitensis antibody titers were elevated at primary diagnosis which fell in responses to antibiotics. This is a second documented incidence of prolonged symptom free incubation of 7 months or longer (10 months this report) of Brucella spp. This patient was symtom-free for 10 months after laboratory exposure to brucella. Although the influenza-like illness may have been the first manifestation of brucellosis, significant morbidity did not occur until 14 months post-exposure.

Device or equipment involved: Unknown

Procedure being performed: Unknown

How LAI / exposure occurred: A 65-y-old male was vacationing in Thailand for 3 days, hiking rural areas and near waterfalls, when he suffered a myocardial infarction. He was hospitalized for 7 days prior to returning to the U.S. One month later he developed dysuria and urinary frequency.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: After the treatment with nitrofurantoin a urine specimen was obtained for culture. After 24 h of icnubation, growth of small colonies was noted on sheep blood agar, with no growth evident on MacConkey agar. The oxidase positive Gram-negative rod (GNR) was identified by MALDI-TOF MS as Burkholderia thailandensis. The culture was discussed during daily rounds, at which point the culture plates were sealed over concern for the possibility of B. pseudomallei. The Washington State Public Health Laboratory identified the organisms as B. pseudomallei with species-specific PCR assay.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: An extensive investigation by the Univeristy of Washington was done to determine the extent of employee exposure in the laboratory. 21 employees were categorized into high- and low-risk exposure groups. Regardles of the exposure risk, all 21 employees were offered antibiotic prophylaxis. Serology testing was performed on exposed individuals, and no employees seroconverted. The ability of technologists to recognize and quarantine bioterrorism agents (BT) is imperative. Nevertheless, because B. pseudomallei grows on both blood and MacConkey agars and is nonpigmented and nonhemolytic, it can be difficult to distinguish from other non-lactose-fermenting Gram-negative rods. With the increasing use of MALDI-TOF MS for bacterial identifications, it is likely that this pathogen may continue to go unrecognized.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: When the patient presented dysuria, nitrofurantoin was prescribed.

Follow-up procedures taken: Cultures of stool grew S. typhimurium. Susceptibilities of the patient´s strain and the laboratory strain were identical, with both strains susceptible by agar dilution to the lowest concentration of all antimicrobials tested. Stool examination showed many fecal leukocytets; three examinations for ova, parasites, and Cryptosporidium yielded negative results. Four blood cultures were negative. Routine urianalysis demonstrated 31 to 40 leukocytes per high-power field and 11 to 20 erhthrocytes per high-power field with occasional leukocyte casts; urine Gram stain and culture were negative.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Unknown

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Because of persistent fever and diarrhea, a 14-day course of ciprofloxacin 500 mg every 12 hours was begun. Fever and diarrhea resolved within 48 hours of initiating antimicrobial therapy. In the week following completion of therapy, however, erythema nodosum, severe arthralgias, and polyarticular arthritis developed.

Follow-up procedures taken: In this study, the authors used PFGE to compare the chromosomal DNA restriction patterns of the 4 strains of S. typhi isolated from the blood samples of the 2 patients and the respective MLTs who processed the patients samples. Isolates were identified biochemically and confirmed by slide agglutination with specific antisera. the 4 stains were bacteriophage type E1 by the Vi-Phage typing method recommended by the International Reference Laboratory for enteric phage typing, Colindale, England. All 4 strains had the same antibiogram:- they were resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole, streptomycin and tetracycline but susceptible to kanamycin, cirpofloxacin, ceftriaxone and norfloxacin by the disc diffusion method.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Unknown PFGE has demonstrated greater sensitivity and reliability in strain differentiation of S. typhi as this method scans from genetic variations over the entire bacterial chromosome. It can be used to complement phage typing and other genotypic techniques for effective epidemiological surveillance.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: clinical microbiology laboratory

Device or equipment involved: unknown

Procedure being performed: culturing of clinical sample

How LAI / exposure occurred: Not fully known. The victim was supervising the technician who was culturing, and did only one processing step- she swabbed colonies from a plate, then immersed the swab in a buffer and shook the buffer. It is not known if droplets from making the suspension could have contaminated the infected technician's gloves, with subsequent release of even one droplet. The infectious dose, according to a cited reference, may be as low as 1 in some instance. Sample processing was conducted on the bench until the isolate was identified. Stool samples on the 6th day were analyzed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis, and the isolates from the LAI and the index patient sample were identical.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Single pair of protective gloves,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: unknown. It was noted that the LAI brought a cell phone into the lab, and use of cell phones at the bench were identified as a potential source of contamination in the CDC investigation of Salmonella outbreaks associated with microbiological teaching laboratories. The author states that the laboratory staff are provided with up-to-date training, handwashing sinks and that appropriate practices are followed/ However, the author notes that wearing gloves has not been universally adopted in micro labs, and cites OSHA's 2011 recommendations that carries glove use through reading and subculturing plates.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Handling the infectious patient sample in the biosafety cabinet, using Biosafety Level 2 practices and PPE.

How LAI / exposure occurred: There were 19 total cases described in this publication with 3 different types of exposure. 6 individuals were working on the identification of "unknowns" during proficiency testing laboratory exercises; these exercises are required for laboratory certification or licensure, and the laboratories were sent a lyophilized culture of S. typhi. Laboatory stock the exposure source for 11 patients; 2 cases were exposed during diagnostic work with clinical isolates. 4 individuals had "laboratory accidents" , and 4 individuals had no direct contact with S. typhi but co-workers had been working with S. typhi as an "unknown". No specific details about the LAI exposure were given. These cases represented 5% of the domestically acquired cases in the US.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: The specifics are unknown, but the MMWR articles goes on to state, strongly, that strict adherence to laboratory safety practices is required, with a focus on hand-to-mouth activities when working with enteric pathogens. The authors state that, with good practices, the exposures should be preventable in most cases. "Immunization is also recommended, but not necessarily required as a condition of employment, for individuals exposed to S. typhi on a daily basis."

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Clinical microbiologists did not wear gloves at that time. Addition of that practice, an emphasis on hand hygiene, and prohibition of hand-to-mouth such as eating, drinking, etc. would have reduced the number of infections.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: unknown.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Microbiological laboratory

Device or equipment involved: Glass culture tube

Procedure being performed: Moving sputum culture with many visible Mycobacterium tuberculosis colonies

How LAI / exposure occurred: While moving the glass culture tube the first laboratory technician ("A") dropped the tube and culture medium spilled into the common hallway shared with other laboratory spaces. Technician A covered the spill with a paper towel soaked in chlorine solution (1,000 ppm). A colleague (laboratory technician "B") helped technician A clean up the spill. Seven personnel working in surrounding spaces connected to common hallway at time of spill could also have been potentially exposed. The two technicians involved in spill clean up were wearing gloves. No other PPE was specifically mentioned, however it was noted that neither individual was wearing respiratory protection while cleaning up spill.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Single pair of protective gloves,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: A contact investigation for all 9 potentially exposed individuals was performed 3 months after the accident occurred. Technician B, who assisted with spill clean up, converted to a positive Tuberculin Skin Test (TST). Technician A, who had been vaccinated with the BCG vaccine, also had a positive TST 3 months post-incident. Five of the 9 individuals who were potentially exposed had received BCG vaccine. Technician B and all 5 vaccinated individuals demonstrated normal chest X-rays. A non-commercial M. tuberculosis specific immunodiagnostic assay was used to screen the 9 potentially exposed individuals, as well as 10 colleagues who had not been at work the day of the accident, and 6 diagnosed TB patients and/or treated TB patients as positive controls. Results from immunoassay for technicians A and B were higher than the other test groups, which was presumed to represent recent infection as a result of the laboratory accident.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: No corrective actions were listed in the reference.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Technicians A and B were treated with Isoniazid for 6 months.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Clinical laboratory

Device or equipment involved: Unknown

Procedure being performed: Strain isolation and identification

How LAI / exposure occurred: Oxford PHL received culture slopes of isolates that had been identified abroad as Moraxella phenylpyruvica, using API20NE panel (greater than 00.5% probability of being M. phenylpyruvica). The specimens came from two patients: blood culture and abscess isolates from the first and blood culture isolate from the second. The organisms were referred for confirmation of identification and, since they had already been identified as M. phenylpyruvica, were handled on the open bench. Three months later, the MLSO who had handled the isolates complained of a febrile, flu-like illness.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: After the MLSO presented flu-like illness, serology performed by Preston PHL gave results compatible with infection by Brucella melitensis and a small, Gram-negative, oxidase-positive, urease-positive coccobacillary organism was cultured from the blood. Isolates from the laboratorian and from the initial samples were sent for additional analysis to the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Weybridge where these were identified as B. melitensis biovar 1.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Microbiologists should note, therefore, that organisms identified as M. phenylpyruvica by API20NE even with a good identification might in fact be Brucella spp., species which are not included in the database. This possibility must be excluded by agglutination with brucella antiserum. A new protocol was established in the Oxford PHL aimed at preventing the risk of exposure when handling isolates received for confirmation from overseas.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: The infected MLSO responded to a course of doxycycline and rifampicin.

Device or equipment involved: Unknown

Procedure being performed: Inoculation procedures

How LAI / exposure occurred: A laboratory technician received three specimens collected from two female prostitutes attending an out-patient clinic in Nairobi, Kenya. The first patient presented with a breast abscess and fever, and pus aspirated from the abscess yielded a small Gram-negative bacillus. Blood cultures taken at the same time were negative, but similar Gram-negative bacillus was isolated from those taken 15 days later. The second patient presented 2 months after the first, with fever and hip pain and blood cultures grew a small Gram-negative bacillus. Culture was performed and incubated at 37°C for up to 7 days and then subcultured in a class 1 safety cabinet. Subsequent work was carried out on the open bench, which is standard procedure unless an organism is known or suspected of being a category 3 pathogen. Three months after the initial isolation, the technician who had handled the organisms on the open bench developed a febrile illness.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Biological safety cabinet,

Follow-up procedures taken: Serology revealed cross-reacting antibodies to both Brucella abortus and B melitensis at a titre of greater than 1:2560. five asymptomatic staff, from the laboratory were also tested and none had titres greater than 1:80. Blood cultures taken from the laboratory technician at the same time grew a small Gram-negative cocco-bacillus from subculture after 9 days incubation. A review of all non fermenting Gram-negative bacilli isolated in the laboratory led to doubt about the identificaction of the Moraxella sp.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: It has become normal practice for a Gram-negative bacillus isolated from blood-culture or pus to be identified using a biochemical kit unless there are good grounds for believing that others forms of identification would be appropriate. The API20NE is designed to identify Gram-negative bacilli not belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family and is widely used throughout Europe. the use of this system was thus the logical next step after the isolation of these organisms, based on their microscopic, cultural and basic biochemical characteristics. Laboratories should be aware of the possible mis-identification of these organisms using API20NE strips.

Procedure being performed: Specimen manipulation

How LAI / exposure occurred: A 62-y-old female presented to the emergency department with left hip pain and was unable to bear weight on that hip. The day before presentation she had fallen while standing up from a sitting position. On presentation the patient was febrile (38,7°C) with a low white blood cell count of 4,300 cells/mcL. One set of blood cultures was obtained, but no antibiotics were given. She denied any exposure to Brucella species such as ingetion of unpasteurized milk or milk products, travel outside the United States, or exposure to domestic farm animals. However, the patient was an experienced medical technologist who had worked in a clinical microbiology laboratory at a large hospital for more than 20 years.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: The isolates were analyzed by bidirectional sequencing of the entire 16S rRNA gene. The sequences were compared to related sequences in the SmartGene 16S eubacterial database.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Brucella species have been recognized worldwide as being pathogenic in a wide variety of animals, including humans. There are several reasons why Brucella species are often misidentified in clinical laboratories. First, Brucella infections are rare, which leads to a lack of experience with this organisms in clinical laboratories. Second, different bacterial idetnification systems are unable to correctly identify Brucella species, which misleads technical staff. Also, Brucella infections are often chronic and present with vague clinical signs. Thus, cultures may be sent to different laboratories at different times. Due to the infectivity of Brucella species, biosafety level 3 practices are recommended for all work with cultures. However, the laboratory must first suspect a Brucella species in order to comply with these measures. This is difficult since species of Brucella phenotypically look similar to several other small Gram-negative bacteria.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: The patient received antibiotic therapy.

How LAI / exposure occurred: A 29-y-old woman worked as a research assistant in a veterinary microbiology laboratory complained of intermittent fever, anorexia, profuse sweating, malaise, headache, normotensive (110/60 mmHg), muscle pain, and arthralgia for 3 d. She was one of the 9 laboratory workers who were involved in a research of isolation of B. melitensis from goats for the past 3 months.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Blood tests against dengue and malaria were negative. She eventualy developed anemia and hypotension (90/50 mmHg) and started to show reduced body weight. Abdominal palpations revealed hepatomegaly and splenomegaly with pain. Brucellosis was suspected before the Rose-Bengal plate test was performed, which revealed the presence of high level of antibiody against Brucella. the same test was repeated after 14 d and the results confirmed the presence of high antibody level against Brucella.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Prolongued follow-up of exposed workers is required, since the incubation period varies from 1 week to 5 months. Similarly, the benefit of early prophylaxis to hte highest risk group was not confirmed since no seroconversion was produced in the high-risk staffs tested.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: She was prescribed vitamin C, paracetamol and cough syrup for common flu. Once that brucellosis was confirmed rifampicine p.o. once a day combined with doxycycline p.o. twice a day for 6 consecutive weeks before she made a full recovery was prescribed.

How LAI / exposure occurred: Thirty-one bacterial isolates from 30 patients sent to the German national reference laboratory were characterized using the genus-specific bcsp31 real-time PCR, the species-specific AMOS-PCR, and standard microbiological methods fro the detection and identification of Brucella spp. The medical records of all patients with bacteriologically confirmed brucellosis were evaluatetd. All 31 isolates proved to be Brucella (30 Brucella melitensis and 1 Brucella suis). Once case of laboratory-acquired infection was identified and identified as german microbiological assistant without a history of travel within the year before onset of disease.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Laboratory and clinical correlation.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Physicians in nonendemic countries such as Germany must be aware of brucellosis being a possible cause of fever of unknown origin in immigrants and tourists travelling from endemic countries.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Unknown for the LAI. Antimicrobial therapy, doxycycline 200 mg/d and rifampin 600-900 mg/d p.o. were used in 15 (50%) cases without focal complications. In four cases (13.3%) doxycycline was combined with streptomycin 1 g/d i.m. or gentamicin 120-240 mg/d i.v./i.m. due to neurobrucellosis, spondylitis, sacroilitis, and chronic brucellosis. A triple therapy using the already-mentioned drugs in combination became necessary in seven cases (23%). A tetra-combination including cotrimoxazole was used in the severe case of neurobrucellosis described. In two cases ciprofloxacin was administred, once in combination with rifampin for 6 weekas due to tetracycline intolerance and once in combination with doxycycline for only 4 weeks, which led to relapse. The duratio of antimicrobial therapy ranged from 4 to 6 months. In four cases, antibiotic treatment was not sufficient to overcome Brucella infection, and surgical intervention became necessary. The two cases of Brucella endocarditis (1 on a natural aortic valve and 1 on a double valvular prosthesis) were finally cured by additional valve replacement.

Procedure being performed: Autopsy of horse

How LAI / exposure occurred: During an autopsy of a symptomatic pony, a veterinary student was removing the brain and spinal cord. Only gloves were worn during the procedure. It is thought that micro-droplets of blood were generated. The route of exposure was thought to be through mucous membranes (eye or nasal). The biosafety level of the veterinary teaching facility was not indicated. Two other people were present during the necropsy but were unaffected. However, since the infected student was the only one infected and the only one to handle neural tissue (brain and spinal cord), it was thought that the higher concentration of the virus in neural tissues was a contributing factor.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Single pair of protective gloves,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Review of safety protocols for necropsy and administration of new protocols to include eye and respiratory protection PPE.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The article references the lack of protection for the eyes or respiratory system as vulnerabilities that should have been used and that corrections were made. LIttle description of the facilities themselves are given. However, a downdraft table for necropsy of animals which died due to infectious disease would be recommended.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Pustular fluid from tnhe lesions was collected and tested fro the presence of bacteria and virus. The Gram stain and cultures were negative for bacteria. When a diluted sample of the pustular fluid was added to BSC-40 (monkey kidney) cell culture, a poxvirus like cytopathic effect was evident after 48 h of infection. Vaccinia virus proteins were detected in infected cells by 12% sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), followed by Western Blot analysis with rabbit antiserum raised against total vaccinia virus proteins. The presence of vaccinia virus genome in the pustular fluid could be demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the phenol-chloroform-extracted DNA from BSC-40 cells infected with the clinical sample for 24 h at 37°C

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Accidental infection with live pathogens by healthcare and laboratory workers has been frequently reported. The risk of infection cannot be avoided, although it can be prevented or minimized by safety measures. Vaccination is still recommended for particular groups, namely, healthcare workers who handle materials potentially infected with vaccinia virus or other orthopoxviruses that infect humans.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Amoxicillin/clavunate (1,750/250 mg per day) was administrated because of a clinical suspicion of secondary bacterial infection. The hand lesions were surgically excised to remove the necrotic tissue, and pustular fluid was collected for analysis. After the surgical procedure, the patient improved slowly until she made a full recovery, and the lesions healed in approximately 3 weeks.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Research laboratory

Device or equipment involved: Unknown

Procedure being performed: Preparation of mixture of adjuvant and AHC virus

How LAI / exposure occurred: Incidentally, laboratory-acquired infection with the virus occurred in two different laboratories where virological studies on AHC virus were carried out in 1974. A patient, A.S., was a male virologist aged 31 years in laboratory A. When he was preparing a mixture of adjuvant and AHC virus, strain J 670/71 of enterovirus 70, the needle came off from the syringe and a droplet of sprash came into his left eye. Another patient K.K., was also a male viriologist and aged 38 in laboratory B. The time of infection was not so clear as in the first case, but it was highly probable that he was infected when he was immunizing rabbit with J 670/71 viral antigen. About 30 hr later he developed conjunctivitis in his left eye.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: He immediately washed his left eye with tap water, he felt irritable sensatio nand pain in his left eye exactly 36 hr after the accident. Swelling of the eye lid, lacrimation and watery secretion in the eye were the initial signs. AHC virus was recovered by HEK cell inoculation with a left eye swab but not from that of the right eye on day 2 post onset. Stools were collected on days 3 to 10 but no virus was isolated. the neutralizing antibody titer to AHC virus was 1:4 on day 2 p.o. and 1:8 on day 30 p.o., namely his antibody response was minimal. Conjuntivitis subsided after a week without any sequela. Hyperemia of the bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva was prominent but no hemorrhage occurred. His right eye was spared from the infection. The conjunctivitis took benign course and he recovered completely in a week. The AHC virus was recovered from a conjunctival swab on the day of the onset, but stools collected on days 1, 14 and 88 p.o. gave negative results for virus isolation.

Device or equipment involved: Unknown

Procedure being performed: Culture handling

How LAI / exposure occurred: On August 10, 1968 a laboratory technician was given a culture of B. dermatitidis to examine grossly and microscopically. The transfer of culture material to slides was not done in a bacteriological hood. On September 12, 1968, the patient noted cough that lasted fro 3 days and concurrent chills and fever. The cough produced approximately 2 tbsp/day of yellowish sputum.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Physical examination in mid-September 1968 was normal. Particularly, there were no cutaneous lesions. X-ray examination 4 days after the onset of symptoms, showed a right hilar adenopathy. One sputum sample was cultured at the time of the X ray and was positive for B. dermatitidis. Comparison with the last previous X ray in 1965 showed that the hilar enlargement was a new finding. Complement fixation studies for blastomycosis in November 1968 were repeatedly negative both in the laboratory.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Handling in the laboratory of molds pathogenic for man represents a risk of infection to the involved technician. This is generally known regarding Histoplasma capsulatum and Coccidioides immitis. This case report emphasizes that a similar risk exists with B. dermatitidis and that scrupulous technique should be used in all laboratory owrk with pathogenic fungi.

A third patient was reported (a nurse and wife of patient 1), developed similar clinical symptoms than patient 1.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Acute-phase and covalescent-phase paired serum specimens from the 3 patients were tested independently by several different laboratories. Results of virus isolation were negative for all samples when tested in Vero and Aedes albopictus mosquito (C6/36) cell cultures and by intracerebral inoculation of acute-phase serum of patient 3 into suckling mice. Likewise, reverse transcriptase-PCRs with 16 different sets of arbovirus-specific primers did not detect arboviral RNA in any of the samples. Hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers and virus neutralizing titers were highly elevated above background levels for ZIKV and yellow fever virus (YFV) compared with other viruses tested. Complement fixation tests against ZIKV and YFV antigens confirmed these interpretations. Hemagglutination inhibition, complement fixation, and virus neutralizing titers against ZIKV alone developed only the convalescent-phase sample of patient 3.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Results support ZIKV transmission from patient 1 to patient 3. Patient 3 had never traveled to Africa or Asia and had not left the U.S. since 2007. Circumstantial evidence suggests direct person-to-person, prossibly sexual, transmission of the virus.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Research laboratory

Device or equipment involved: Syringe containing a live vaccine B. abortus

Procedure being performed: Vaccine testing

How LAI / exposure occurred: A veterinarian accidentally stabbed his lip with a living vaccine of Brucella abortus. Had a three day history of night sweats, headache, elevated temperature of 40.6°C, nausea and vomiting.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: The patient was treated as a case of brucellosis. Three blood cultures and a blood sample for Brucella titre were submited to the Microbiology Laboratory at St. Joseph´s Health Centre, London, Ontario. This patient was addmited to hospital. Blod cultures were collected into Bactec(TM) bottles. Biochemical screening tests: Oxidase - Positive; Catalase - Positive; Urea - Positive (within 30 minutes); H2S (using PbA) - Positive (after 48 hours). The Brucella isolates were grown in a liver infusion broth and a formalised suspension prepared by adding 0.5 % formaldehyde. The organism isolated from the patient tested against the known brucella abortus antiserum gave a titre of 1:640. Control antigen/antiserum was 1:640. No dye inhibition tests were performed.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: the clinical diagnosis on the laboratory requisition read "Brucella infection". A telephone call to the physician confirmed that the laboratory was, indeed, dealing with a case of brucellosis. As a result, all the necessary precautions were taken in handling the blood cultures and isolates on the solid agar plates. A difficult problem for medical technologists and microbiologists is the infection caused by a rerely isolated organism, such as Brucella, which requires special precautionary methods, selective media and specialized biochemical and other reagents. The need for better aseptic technique with the administration of vaccines, when dealing with animals must be stressed.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: I.V. achromycin 500 mgm. q.6.h. was begun. Treatment was continued for seven days in hospital and oral therapy with vibramycin 100 mgm. b.i.d. for seven days thereafter. After six weeks, the patient experienced night sweats again and he was placed on erythromycin in the form of EES 600 three times daily for a further 10 days.

Procedure being performed: spill/splash, pipetting

How LAI / exposure occurred: Of the nine LAIs cited, only two are described. In one case, during animal inoculation, the needle "popped off the syringe," splashing the workers. In the second case, the technician did not normally work with R. rickettsii, but visited another person in the lab for 15 minutes while that person was pipetting "in a laminar flow hood". As that was his only known exposure, it was believed that he was exposed via aerosol.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Personnel were treated with antimicrobials as appropriate.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: This paper examines historical LAIs in their facility, and argues that the RMSF vaccine, which was discontinued in their facility in 1971, provided more protection than previously realized. Personnel who had been vaccinated showed a less severe course of disease than more recent personnel, who had not been vaccinated. The paper does not mention PPE, work practices, or safety equipment.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: In one case, three people were exposed. Two chose prophylactic antibiotics, and did not develop disease. One (who was vaccinated) chose not to take prophylactic antibiotics, and did develop disease.

How LAI / exposure occurred: A total of nine laboratorians (six from the Broward County hospital Case 1) and three from the Miami-Dade County hospital Case 2) had high-risk exposures which was categorized based on whether isolates had been manipulated outside of primary containment (ie. a biosafety cabinet) or if isolates were manipulated in such a way that could have resulted in aerosol or droplet formation. In Case 1, all six laboratorians reported handling the diagnostic specimen outside of the biosafety cabinet. In Case 2, all three laboratorians reported sniffing the culture plates. None of the nine exposed laboratorians reported symptoms consistent with melioidosis.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: All nine laboratorians from Case 1 (n = 6) and Case 2 (n = 3) were offered prophylaxis and anti-B. pseudomallei antibody testing.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: - Clinical specimens suspected of containing B. pseudomallei should manipulated using biosafety level (BSL)-2 containment practices, equipment, and facilities. Any manipulations of the specimens that could result in aerosols or droplets should be performed in BSL-3. - Sniffing culture plates should be prohibited. - Clinicians should notify laboratorians when specimens are obtained from patients with symptoms, risk factors, or history suggestive of melioidosis.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Case 1: No post-exposure prophylaxis was prescribed for the six laboratorians based on negative diagnostic serology results. Case 2: All three laboratorians requested prophylaxis. Prescribed prophylaxis is unknown.

Device or equipment involved: varies

Procedure being performed: varies

How LAI / exposure occurred: This paper describes the results from two separate investigations into LAIs: 1) a survey was sent to 115 BSL3 and BSL4 laboratories worldwide, of which 23 responded. These laboratories gave detailed answers as to the type of laboratory, the exposure route, the PPE worn, and the treatment. Cases were found to result from airborne exposure, percutaneous exposure, equipment failure, not wearing PPE, animal bites/scratches, splashes/spills, and inadequate compliance with safety rules. They attribute human error to 78% of the LAI underlying causes. The following LAI were reported from the survey: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (10), Coxiella burnetii (2), Brucella melitensis (2) and Foamy virus (1). 2) a literature review of LAIs over the last 35 years was performed. The autihors believe that this review demonstrates a very low rate of LAIs for highly pathogenic microorganisms, and attribute that low rate to the improvement of working conditions.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Other PPE,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Other engineering control,

Follow-up procedures taken: Follow-up is described vaguely for the survey results, and varies depending on case.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The authors devote a significant part of the discussion to preventing future exposure. They suggest training personnel to reduce human error, avoiding the involvement of people with psychological conditions by means of medical monitoring, and establishing a safety culture.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Varies depending on case. Unknown in many cases.

Procedure being performed: Animal handling

How LAI / exposure occurred: Since November 1989, evidence of active filovirus infection has been detected in cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis) monkeys imported from the Philipines to quarantine facilities in Virginia, Pennsylvania and Texas. Antibody to one or more filovirus antigens has been detected in six of the 178 persons tested as of April 23. It is likely that one of the four was infected when he lacerated a finger while performing a necropsy on an infected animal, the mode of transmission for the other three is unknown. The other two persons were seropositive and low titer and had evidence of past infection; one of these persons, a worker at a facility that temporarily houses nonhuman primates before delivery to U.S. quarantine facilities, has had regular contact with quarantined monkeys for 3 years.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Epidemiologic and laboratory studies suggest that there is a risk of transmission of filoviruses to humans that is associated with routine handling and management of quarantined nonhuman primates.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: According to the authors, studies are in progress to quantify and better define the risk of infection among persons working with nonhuman primates in U.S. quarantine facilities and among their household and sexual contacts. In addition more studies are under way to better define the frequency and duration of importation of these agents into the United States. CDC implemented a procedure, effectively immediately, requiring the issurance of a special permit from the Director, CDC, beore importation of individual shipments of cynomolgus, rhesus, and African green monkeys into the U.S.A. Registered importers of nonhuman primates have been notified of the requirement to submit a detailed written plan that specifies steps that will be taken to prevent exposure of persons and animals to filoviruses during the entire importation and quarantine process for imported nonhuman primates.

Procedure being performed: Manipulation of calves

How LAI / exposure occurred: Six newborn calves, experimentally infected with Cryptosporidium oocysts of murine origin, were isolated in the research unit in the Department of MEdicine at the Coolege of Veterinary Medicine. On days 8-10 the researcher fortuitously had to ask 5 veterninary students, on duty in the Department, to take her place. Students were informed about the zoonotic nature of cryptosporidiosis and the hygienic measures needed for self-protection. Each of the 5 students worked in the research facility only once, afterwards continuing clinical duties on large animal practice at the clinics. During the next week all students experienced several signs of illness: their main complaint was diarrhoea. As the disease occurred suddenly, the outbreak was assumed to have a common source, the nature of the disease suggesting cryptosporidiosis.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Single pair of protective gloves, Other PPE,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: A total of 62 faecal samples, of which 55 were human from 43 persons, were examined in duplicates by the smear method and the formalin-ether concentration method.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The persons exposed to the infected calves had obeyed the instructions given for hygiene practices, and they were not found to spread the infection to suceptible calves in a separate facility. However, there had apparently been deficiencies in personal hygiene measures; e.g. the use of protective face masks should have been required. It is also conceivable that the students had not attained the highest level of personal hygiene practice and good working habits, as they had started their clinical studies only 6 months earlier. Cryptosporidiosis can certainly be considered an occupational risk for farmers, animal handlers, veterinary students and surgeons, laboratory personnel and research workers as being capable of crossing the interface between man and animals. Special training programmes for all persons exposed, as well as strict precautions in the handling of diarrhoeic calves, shuld be stressed.

Device or equipment involved: Unknown

Procedure being performed: Unknown

How LAI / exposure occurred: During a four week period from July 26th to August 24th, four members of the staff of the National Institute of Virology, Pune (NIV), reported sick with a mild febrile illness wich lasted for 3 to 5 days. Earlier in January 1977, another member of the staff of the NIV had suffered from a similar mild illness, Ganjam virus was isolated from the acute-phase serum samples of all the five patients. Two of the five individuals had been working with Ganjam virus shortly prior to the onset of their illness. Although none of the other three patients gave a history of handling Ganjam virus for at least a month prior to their illness, the evidence was strongly suggestive of a common source of infection in the laboratory.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Only two of the five individuals had been working with Ganjam virus shortly prior to their onset of illness. None of the other three individuals gave a history of handling Ganjam virus for at least a month prior to their illness. All the three worked in the same glassware washing and equipment preparation section. Their duties consisted of decontamination of infected glassware and washing. They were possibly infected while handling inadequately decontaminated glassware. Blood samples were collected by venepuncture. Haematological invetigations in the acute phase of illness were carried out in four of the five cases. Complement fixation tests for the idetnification of virus isolates and for testing serum samples were performed according to standard procedures followed at the NIV. Neutralization tests were carried out.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The occurrence of five laboratory infections leading to overt disease within a relatively short period of time, demonstrates the infectious potential of Ganjam virus to laboratory workers. It is interesting that in this aspect it is similar to other tick-borne viruses.

Procedure being performed: washing plates to fix virus

How LAI / exposure occurred: During a podcast discussing the first ever published account of vaccina virus infection via aerosol, one of the podcast members (possibly Rich Condit) mentions that a similar infection happened in a lab where he was working. Few details are given, and the incident was not published. The podcaster states that a process in his lab involved washing plates containing the virus to fix them. He acknowledges that this washing could have generated large amounts of aerosols, but most literature on vaccinia does not state aerosols are a risk. One laboratory worker developed a lung infection, with lesions elsewhere on his body, that was confirmed to be vaccinia virus. Personal communication (KB) with the podcast virologist, Richard Condit, gathered additional details. The graduate student would "fix" the plates with crystal violet in 20% alcohol for 10 minutes, and then rinse the plates under running tap water. After the LAI, the lab added 10% formaldehyde fixation to the plates and required vaccination for people working in the lab. No other infections were reported. NOTE: the vaccinia virus infection via aerosol that was the subject of the published paper was not a laboratory acquired infection. Skins from purposefully-infected animals were being prepared for traditional Asian medicines.

How LAI / exposure occurred: The technician was assigned to stool culture one week before he became ill. The individual was a strict vegetarian, which rules out food-borne acquisition. None of the samples were described as bloody, and the organism was not isolated from any of the stools worked on. However, the organism has a very infectious dose. In 1987, Washington became the first US state to do surveillance for 0157: one of the goals of making it a reportable illness was to increase screening for this organism.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: In general, the paper states that antimicrobial medication did not appear to alter the risk of developing hemolytic-uremic syndrome or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The author states that person-to-person transmission was only documented between siblings, and from child to parent. "Enteric precautions infection control precautions seem warranted for any patient who has this infection. These precautions should also extend to the laboratory, since the case in the microbiology technician suggests the possibility of transmission in this setting." In today's language, strict Biosafety Level 2 precautions are required for work with stool cultures.

Procedure being performed: antibiotic sensitivity tests

How LAI / exposure occurred: The Salmonella and Shigella control strains were stored on slants, The 0157 culture was stored in a stack with the control strains used for antibiotic sensitivity testing. At some point, the culture of E. coli 0157 was inadvertently used for routine antibiotic sensitivity testing instead of the E. coli (NCTC10418). The 0157 culture was fully sensitive, so the switch was not noticed. The publication states that exactly how the exposure occurred is not known, but states that other reports of LAI with E. coli 0157 occurred without any identified lapses in good laboratory practice. The infectious dose is very low.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: After the infection was diagnosed, follow-up cultures were done on other laboratory staff, family members, family pet, and foodstuffs — the results were all negative. The infected trainee had a faecal isolate of E. coli 0157 phage type 54; that is an unusual phage type, and the E.coli 0157 culture in the lab was also phage type 54.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Separate, very clearly labeled storage would have prevented the handling of E.coli 0157 in routine antibiotic sensitivity testing.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: The trainee received treatment developed bloody diarrhea, then haemolytic uremic syndrome.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: college classrooms

Device or equipment involved: Sharples centrifuge

Procedure being performed: only 1 student had been inside the Brucella lab

How LAI / exposure occurred: The first case of Brucella on December 10, 1938, was in a student assistant in a bacteriology lab near the Brucella lab. "Since several cases of Brucellosis have occurred in past years in individuals directly associated with brucellosis investigations, the occurrence of infection in this individual was not considered as unusual." The investigation was opened when a large number became infected. Analysis of the 45 clinical and 49 subclinical LAIs revealed that all but 2 had taken one of 3 bacteriology laboratory courses. No materials containing Brucella were given to students. The plumber installed an autoclave, in the basement, where the Brucella lab was. The 37degree warm room for culture incubation opened into the basement hallway corridor. Used glassware, prior to decontamination, was carried in closed containers to a wash room. The Sharples centrifuge was in the hallway of the basement, and was used for Brucella the second week of November. ( It has previously been used with Brucella 100 times since1929. Back-siphoning of water from contaminated glassware, or sewage contamination of drinking or handwashing water, were investigated as sources but dismissed.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure:

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure:

Follow-up procedures taken: Only Brucella melitensis was cultured from 36 of the students' blood, indicating a mass exposure. Extensive experiments on the plumbing were done; back-siphoning was ruled out. Also, the experimental animals drinking the water did not become ill. Testing of former students was conducted - the author states that 10-15% of the students taking classes in that building may have been infected.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The elimination of work with Brucella without sufficient containment to prevent exposure to other building occupants. Elimination of the Sharples centrifuge, and incubation of cultures inside the Brucella laboratory, assuming it was under negative pressure (not stated in the article) would have been helpful. Surprisingly, aerosol transmission is not mentioned or examined.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Not stated. Some students were unable to return for their second semester.

Follow-up procedures taken: Extensive testing was conducted. Antibody results from testing the wife, two daughters, 4 individuals in the LAI's laboratory, and 3 staff from the antigen production group did not indicate infection. One staff from the antigen production group had a titer of 1:32; he had worked in a production facility with C. burnetii for over a year. Since the infected person had also worked in his garden, which was fertilized with chicken manure, a few gardeners from the community plot were also tested - 1 had a titer of 1;32, but he had kept cows and sheep, and drank raw milk, until 2 years previously. It was considered unlikely that either of the seropositive individuals had the same source of infection as the LAI. 5 of the 25 mothers who gave birth during the placenta study were tested, and none were seropositive. However, the authors point out that 1 of the other 20 mothers could have been seropositive. The author states that C. brunetii isolation from a human placenta has been described in the literature 4 times.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Aerosol-producing procedures should be conducted in the biosafety cabinet.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Not described.

How LAI / exposure occurred: This paper focuses on a technique for strain typing and identification. As part of their testing, they evaluated the assay's ability to identify the source of five separate LAI brucellosis incidents. Three of the incidents involved laboratorians exposed to a single culture (2 B. melitensis, 1 B. suis), and the assay showed 100% match between the known exposed culture and the LAI. One incident involved exposure to two B. melitensis cultures, and the assay was able to determine that one culture had 100% match while the other had 40% match. The final incident involved exposure to 48 B. melitensis cultures. The assay showed that the culture from the laboratorian matched two of the potential exposure cultures at 100%, but not the other 46.

How LAI / exposure occurred: The exposure is not described. However, the disease in sheep has a mortality of about 50-95 percent. The author states that it is usually a mild flu-like illness in man; the author is aware of about 200 cases in East Africa that fit that description. However, this fatal laboratory-acquired case was the first in America.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: The infected individual was hospitalized 24 hours after symptoms appeared. The diagnosis of Rift Valley Fever was confirmed by the following procedures. Blood was drawn and injected into mice; the mice died within 48 hours and the histology of the livers indicated Rift Valley Fever. Blood from the infected mice, and blood drawn on the patient the day after admission, also killed mice. The patient improved, and was allowed to sit up on day 12. However, on day 16, he developed phlebitis in one leg, and on day 20 he had a pulmonary embolism in the chest. A second and a third infarct occurred on day 26 and 34. The patient died on day 45 of hospitalization from a large pulmonary embolus. The development of thrombophlebitis was an unexpected complication of Rift Valley Fever, but the author noted that it occurs with a number of other viral diseases.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Careful Biosafety Level 3 practices, at a minimum, may have prevented infection.

How LAI / exposure occurred: This paper describes the results of a survey sent to clinical laboratories in Japan. The authors were interested in identifying LAIs and laboratory incidents. They were able to identify 28 possible cases of laboratory-acquired tuberculosis, and note that 25 of these cases were associated with not having a biosafety cabinet. They identify other risk factors including "immature skills" and "insufficiently skilled equipment operation." The authors note frequent "rupture accidents" when centrifuging blood and collecting acid-fast bacilli, as well as accidents "related to inadequate sample tube materials." They also document 1,534 "self-inflicted" needlestick injuries. This paper is written in Japanese, and only the abstract has been translated into English.

The healthcare workers, despite taking no respiratory precautions, did not convert to positive TB skin tests. The five personnel in the autopsy suite, however, did convert. The author believes that transmission occurred through aerosolization when an oscillating bone saw was used to open the body, and also from water aerosolized during examination of organs.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Wrap around gown, Other PPE,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Other engineering control,

Follow-up procedures taken: Any person who converted to a positive TB test was treated with antibiotics.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The paper recommends that all autopsies take place in rooms with negative-pressure airflow and UV lights, and that personnel in the autopsy area should wear respirators.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Antibiotic treatment of personnel who converted to a positive skin test.

Biological Safety Level (BSL) for work being performed?: BSL-2

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: clinical laboratory

Device or equipment involved: Blood culture

Procedure being performed: Isolation of organisms from positive cultures

How LAI / exposure occurred: The authors examined the rates of isolation of Brucella melitensis from computerized laboratory records in an area of southern Israel where Brucella is endemic. During the 8-year period of 2002-2009, 514 of the 20, 620 aerobic blood culture vials were positive, or 2.5%. In 2008, the rate peaked at 5.3%. The authors state that the safety recommendation for processing of blood cultures in an endemic area is that this procedure should only occur in a class II biosafety cabinet. The authors then state "However, "by the time the organism is identified, extensive manipulation of culture media has already been performed and inadvertent exposure of laboratory personnel may have already occurred'.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure:

Follow-up procedures taken: The authors recommend that, to reduce the risk of transmission, ALL positive blood culture vials in endemic areas should be processed in a biosafety cabinet.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Ideally, ALL positive blood cultures would be manipulated in the biosafety cabinet, even when the laboratory is not located in an area where Brucella is endemic.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Research laboratory

Device or equipment involved: Syringe

Procedure being performed: Inoculation of mice

How LAI / exposure occurred: A 26-year-old laboratory worker was inoculating mice with vaccinia vaccine as part of research into cross-reactivity among poxviruses. After inoculating two mice, he suffered a needlestick injury to the left index finger. Two days later, a cloudy vesicle, typical of vaccinia virus appeared at the inoculation site. After 3 more days, the finger became acutely inflamed, with secondary lymphangitis and axillary lymphadenitis.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: After antibacterial therapy, the lymphangitis and lymphadenitis rapidly resolved and the vesicle disappeared within 10 days. The man remained well.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Infection with vaccinia usually follows vaccination or needlestick injuries. Prior immunisation with vaccinia vaccine is thought to prevent or reduce the severity of such infections, and it is recommended that people working with vaccinia or related orthopoxviruses be vaccinated every 10 years. Given the potential dangers from accidental exposure and the fact that the last documented case of smallpox in 1978, was related to a laboratory incident, strict infection control measures are paramount, including disinfection after injury, prompt reporting, urgent medical review and measures to minimise secondary spread to contacts.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Unknown.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Autopsy of a patient who was not diagnosed with tuberculosis prior to death, but that was determined to have systemic infection with M. Tuberculosis at autopsy.

Device or equipment involved: Routine autopsy instruments including use of an oscillating bone saw

Procedure being performed: Autopsy including use of oscillating bone saw to open rib cage and calvarium, and to section several vertebrae.

How LAI / exposure occurred: Ten individuals participated in an autopsy on a patient who had not been diagnosed with tuberculosis. Upon autopsy lungs of patient showed extensive pneumonia, tubercule bacilli were seen in samples taken from the lung, lymph nodes, spleen, peritoneum, kidneys, testes, brain, and vertebrae. Cultures of all tissues, blood, and ascetic fluid were all positive for M. Tuberculosis. Of the ten individuals in the autopsy suite 5 had history of positive PPD tests prior to autopsy and 5 individuals were negative in previous PPD tests. When retested 8 weeks after autopsy, all 5 individuals showed strong reaction to PPD.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Wrap around gown, Other PPE,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Sputum cultures were obtained from 5 personnel with PPD conversion. Cultures from two of the five individuals were positive for M. Tuberculosis.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Use of appropriate engineering controls (e.g. downdraft table) and respiratory protection, particularly in combination with use of bone saw may have prevented exposures.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Of personnel who had skin test conversions, individuals with positive sputum cultures were treated with rifampin and isoniazid for 6 months. Individuals with negative sputum cultures were treated with isoniazid (300 mg/day) for 6 months. All ten individuals remained healthy 6 months post-autopsy.

How LAI / exposure occurred: This paper describes a review of 448 individuals who were evaluated for potential exposure to both "bioterrorist and nonbioterrorist agents." Over time, the average number of exposures was 13/year with 1.7/year needlestick injuries. Potential bacterial exposures were associated with aerosols, while potential viral exposures were associated with percutaneous events. The paper describes vaccine protocols prior to exposure, and prophylactic treatment after exposure, and goes into some detail about policy decisions on when to vaccinate and when to provide PEP. Documented disease was identified for Y. pestis (possible), B. mallei, Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis, Chikungunya, and Vaccinia.

How LAI / exposure occurred: A 2012 survey of LAIs in Flanders (a region of Belgium) was performed, and received so much national and international attention that the survey was repeated nation-wide. Both surveys covered the same timeframe (2007-2012), but the second survey had more questions and requested more detail, with the result that some cases were reported in different sections compared to the first survey. The second survey was also more anonymous than the first, so it is not possible to guarantee that all cases reported to the first survey were also reported to the second survey. This paper goes into great detail about the types of LAIs, the significance of the LAIs, and the identified areas of future improvement.

How LAI / exposure occurred: Summary of exposures in CDC database from 1985 to 2013, involved health care workers in all fields of operation. 58 confirmed cases involved the handling of infected fluids or infected equipment resulting in percutaneous puncture or cut (49 cases), mucocutaneous exposure(5), both percutaneous and mucocutaneous exposure (2), and unknown (2). An additional 150 possible cases of HIV infection were reported where the method of exposure was not documented but the infection was attributed to the workplace activities of the health care workers which included the occupations listed above and maintenance, housekeeping, security and other staff not directly documenting interaction with patients or infected materials. While many of these cases preceded the recommendation of Universal Precautions, the article notes that only 1 case occurred after 1999 when Universal Precautions were adopted across the U.S.

Biological Safety Level (BSL) for work being performed?: -none-

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: animal room with 200 Syrian hamsters and a photocopier

Device or equipment involved: Most staff entered the room to use the copier.

Procedure being performed: photocopying documents

How LAI / exposure occurred: The virus is aerosolized by rodent excretion. The 200 Syrian hamsters were not known to be infected; monitoring practices for LCM were not routine as they are now. The outbreak resulted in illnesses characterized by fever, prostatration, headache and myalgia. There was "little" evidence of meningitis, no sequelae from infections; however, convalescence was prolonged. 6 individuals had positive serum antibody tests. LCMVwas isolated from the hamsters by injected tissue into LCM-free mice.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Not worn (specifically stated in article)

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure:

Follow-up procedures taken: Since some commercially obtained hamsters at that time were infected, the authors recommended special practices for the use of the animals and tumor cell lines that were passaged in infected hamsters. The colony was probably destroyed, since the authors pointed out that "contamination of the hamster colony makes it useless for cancer research since LCMvirus has a sparing effect on tumor-bearing hamsters, mice, and guinea pigs. Restricted access to hamster colonies and monitoring for LCM infection was also recommended."

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Restricting access to the animal facility; moving the copier to a location accessible to office staff to reduce the number of potential exposures. Routine colony monitoring.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Not applicable.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Research laboratory

Device or equipment involved: Syringe

Procedure being performed: Manipulation of mice

How LAI / exposure occurred: Accidental injection of a human colonic adenocarcinoma cell line across HLA disparities into an otherwise healthy laboratory worker, with the subsequent sustained growth of a tumor nodule. The patient was a healthy 19-y-old woman employed in a laboratory outside the National Institutes of Health, who had no clinical history to suggest immune deficiency. When she was injectging mice, her left hand was accidentally punctured by a needle that had previously been used to draw up a suspension of a human colonic adecnocarcinoma cell line. No apparent injection of the suspension ocurred; however, a superficial wound with a small amount of bleeding was noted. Two weeks later, she noticed a small nodule at the point of the needlestick.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: An excisional biopsy of a nodule measuring 9 by 4 by 4 mm was performed on day 19 after the injection. Examination of the excised nodule revealed adenocarcinoma, which was mucin-positive and immunoreactive for carcinoembryonic antigen. No inflammatory response or necrosis of the tumor was present. The patient underwent a wide excision of the area of inoculation. No residual tumor was found. She has remained well for four years, without evidence of recurrence of the tumor. HLA typing of the patient showed HLA A2, A11, B44, and Bw55, and typing of the cell line showed HLA A2, B13, and Bw50

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The authors wish to make laboratory personnel working with malignant human cell lines aware of the potential danger of accidental inoculation, and they recommend that the possibility of transmission of malignant disease be considered before untreated live allogenic tumor cells are used in cancer immunotherapy protocols.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Excisional biopsy of the nodule

Device or equipment involved: Unknown

Procedure being performed: Western blot assays

How LAI / exposure occurred: A 38-y-old technician who was tested yearly for antibodies against microorganisms that he manipulated in Western blot assays had never previously exhibited antibodies to the mimivirus. On 15 December 2004, he experienced a dry cough that had worsened during the night.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown, Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: Approximately 15 days after the onset of the cough, he presented with fever (temperature, 39°C), chills, weakness, and reproductive cough. In addition to weakness and productive cough, the patient also reported transfixing pain in his chest. A radiograph of the chest showed bilaterial basilar infiltrates suggesting viral pneumonia. The results of the serologic studies for usual pneumonia-causing agents were negative, but mimivirus seroconversion form less than 1:50 to 1:3200 was documented. The authors used electrophoresis to test the patient's serum. The patient was exposed to the virus, developed pneumonia, and exhibited seroconversion to 23 different specific proteins-4 of which were encoded by very specific genes without homologue in the National Institutes of Health GenBank. Therefore, the cross-reactions were unlikely. The inefficacy of antibiotic treatment and the negative results of tests performed on other antigens reinforced the authors opinion.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The case presented here provides additional evidence that the mimivirus may be a cause of clinically important infection. In addition, the authors considered that mimivirus hsould be treated as a class 2 pathogen as has been described as a pneumonia agent.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate, 2 g/d for 8 days, was initiated. On day 23, he returned for follow-up evaluation because his symptoms had not improved. The patient slowly recovered.

How LAI / exposure occurred: At the time this article was written, the exposure to SARS that resulted in infection of 2 researchers was not known. Secondary and tertiary cases were linked to the LAI; including the fatal infection of the mother of the infected researcher. The article includes a good description of the first incident, which occurred in Singapore, in which a graduate student was infected while working in a BL3 facility to grow West Nile virus."Inappropriate laboratory procedures led to cross-contamination of the West Nile virus with SARS. There is also a good description of the second incident resulting in a SARS LAI in Taiwan. The researcher had been working in BL4 for long hours each day over a long period, and was exposed from droplets when cleaning a spill in the laboratory transport chamber. The threat of polio reintroduction was described when a reference strain of poliovirus type ! was isolated from a child with diarrhea. The child's parent worked at a factory where inactivated polio vaccine was produced from that strain; an accident had occurred at the plant. The child was fully immunized, but was a carrier. SARS exposure in Chinese CDC Lab Normile, D 2004: unknown, the individuals developed symptoms on 25/3/2004, and 17/4/2004, respectively

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Not described,

Follow-up procedures taken: Immediate flushing of the needlestick site. The laboratorian was sent to the emergency room, but no treatment was provided, and one paper notes that no counseling on transmission (to other household members) was provided. Upon development of symptoms, the laboratorian was treated in an occupational health clinic, and was eventually admitted to the hospital. The laboratorian was treated with tecovirimat, a novel antiviral intended for use against smallpox. The laboratorian made a full recovery, but was still experiencing effects 94 days after the event. She was excluded from work for 4 months.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The laboratorian refused vaccination before beginning the work.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: The paper notes that there was no counseling to prevent auto-inoculation or secondary transmission. The wound was immediately flushed, but antivirals were not provided until admission to the hospital. Tecovirimat was used for the first time in treating vaccinia.

How LAI / exposure occurred: Little information about this outbreak is available, but according to various press releases and websites, "dozens" (96 according to two sources) of Chinese researchers from the Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute (Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences) have tested positive for brucellosis antibodies. These reports claim that none of the researchers, at least some of whom worked in a food-and-mouth disease prevention lab, have shown clinical symptoms (there is some conflicting information there), and it is not known how they were exposed. One source claims that research mice were infertile, and the cause of that infertility was determined to be Brucellosis. Upon discovering that, personnel who worked in that lab were tested and also found to be positive for Brucella antibodies.

Date(s) of LAI / exposure: Prior to 1974

Location where LAI / exposure occurred: Houston, Texas, USA

Occupation(s) of affected personnel: Laboratory staff conducting biochemical studies

Age(s) of affected personnel: not stated

Agent(s) involved: Pichinde virus (Arenavirus)
find in Risk Group Databasearrow (NOTE: you may have to edit search to be more specific)

Biological Safety Level (BSL) for work being performed?: unknown

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: High concentrations of virus were handled in a research laboratory

Device or equipment involved: Not stated

Procedure being performed: biochemical studies

How LAI / exposure occurred: 6 of the 13 individuals working in the same laboratory developed antibodies. Five of those who became seropositive were using high concentrations of virus for biochemical studies became infected. The sixth individual was doing biological studies and had a needlestick while inoculating hamsters. A month after the needlestick, he developed "mild dysuria, myalgia, and a vesicular eruption of the left thumb, which might be the portal of entry."

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: This was not stated, but the authors concluded that the capability of Pichinde to produce infection is dose related.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: In the absence of procedural details, it is not clear whether Biosafety Level 2 practices were followed carefully for the biochemical studies. However, in the absence of data, it would be reasonable to use Biosafety Level 3 practices for work with high concentrations of a virus apparently being characterized in this laboratory. Safety-engineered needles would not have been available in 1974, and the incident leading to the accidental needlestick is not described. However, use of anesthesia when injecting an Arenavirus would be appropriate.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Unknown Authors recommend adherence to safety practices and monitoring staff.

Procedure being performed: serologic testing

How LAI / exposure occurred: Known positive reference samples were sent to clinical laboratories, in a College of Pathology quality assurance program from November 2004 to February 2005. 3, 748 international laboratories received the samples, including 6 laboratories in Germany. Each laboratory received 3 identical samples containing live virus; 2 were for virus antigen detection and one for virus culture. Because this influenza strain was known not to have been circulated in the environment since 1968, the authors used this as a chance to identify any possible LAIs or exposures due to laboratory work. None of the laboratories reported breaches in safety practices and no persons had more than or equal to 3 influenza-like symptoms within 4 days after working with the samples. Serological monitoring was conducted on 14 staff who had worked with the samples and could theoretically have been exposed. 15 staff members born before 1969 also participated. The authors concluded that there was no evidence of LAI, but admitted it was a small sample.

Biological Safety Level (BSL) for work being performed?: unknown

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Individual participated in the preparation of an experimental lot of animal Rabies vaccine in a commercial laboratory

Device or equipment involved: A “kitchen type” blender, was used to prepare a homogenate of rabid goat brains. The mixing jar was covered with a loose “slip-fit” plastic lid. He then would transfer homogenate aliquots by mouth pipetting to small jars. The pipette consisted of a flexible rubber tubing on one end affixed to the pipette and the other end held in the mouth.

Procedure being performed: Homogenization of brain tissue in a blender and transfer of aliquots to multiple container by pipetting from one container to the other using the flexible tubing/pipette device

How LAI / exposure occurred: The individual probably removed the mask that he was supposed to be wearing and spent some minutes with his face just above the opening of the blender jar as he was transferring aliquots into various containers.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Not worn (specifically stated in article)

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: An epidemiological investigation was conducted to ascertain the source of the infection. The individual did not describe any animal contact or animal bites to co-workers or relatives. There was no known visits to bat caves or contact with bats. However, there was a single laboratory exposure that occurred 12 days before the onset of illness but relatives and co-workers were confident that there had not been exposure to rabies.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: 1. Gown, gloves and mask were required when performing the homogenization. It was suspected that the individual removed his mask while working alone. The technician who assisted the individual during part of the process reported that he had wore all required PPE. 2. Public Health Service (today’s CDC) and WHO recommend that only persons vaccinated and with demonstrable serum antibody against rabies be permitted to work in the laboratory with this agent.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Unknown - the individual had received four doses of rabies vaccine (experimental never licensed) in 1958 for preexposure immunization but had not developed a positive serum antibody response when tested the following year. He did not receive additional vaccine doses during the 13 years between the initial immunization and the onset of illness. Blood samples collected on 3Mar1972 and 9Mar1972 (acute and terminal stages) were negative and positive, respectively for serum antibody.

How LAI / exposure occurred: A survey of 97 US laboratory animal care technicians (LAT) attending the annual AALAS conference in Denver, CO in 2009 sought to identify risk factors associated with Coxiella burnetii seropositivity. Antibodies to C. burnetii were detected in blood samples from six individuals (6% of the participants) : a 2X greater prevalence than in the general population. Seropositivity was associated with the following risk factors: (a) breeding cattle within the respondent's facility, (b) any current job contact with waste from beef cattle or goats, and (c) exposure to animal waste during previous jobs or outside current job duties. (Note: the prevalence of PPE use is reported in the paper both (within work and outside of work), but the actual PPE worn at the time of exposure is not known).

Device or equipment involved: Centrifuge use is mentioned prior to inoculation of animals with virus suspension preparation.

Procedure being performed: Technician had been trained to assist in the preparation of virus suspensions and centrifugation prior to inoculation of experimental animals.

How LAI / exposure occurred: Two weeks prior to hospitalization the worker's right wrist was deeply scratched by an uninoculated monkey. This injury is believed to have provided the virus entry route. Virus contamination of hands subsequent to this injury is proposed. Technician died 2 days after hospitalization, and necropsy revealed the presence of poliomyelitis virus in axillary lymph nodes on the right but not the left side of his body, among other areas. This necropsy finding supports the belief that the wrist injury provided the route of entry for the virus.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: There was strong public reaction since this was a strain of NDV that had "devastated" poultry farms in Australia in the 30's. The Director "regretted" the inadequate counseling, since the tissues used to wipe the technician's eyes were discarded into a rubbish bin, and wild bird could have picked up the virus while foraging in the bin. The New Wales Farmers Association filed an injunction to prevent the Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) from importing exotic animal viruses for research or diagnostic purposes. An independent inquiry was started to review breaches in procedure. Noted was the fact that the Acting Director was not notified until 5 days after the incident, the veterinary officer was not notified for a week, and the poultry industry was never notified. Changes in procedures were instituted,

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Standard operating procedures for use of the concentration device, and a face shield.

Until 1971, the virus was endemic only in Sagar, Sorab, and Shikaripur taluks (counties) of Shimoga District . In 1972, a new focus of viral activity was identified in Sirsi Taluk, Ultra Kannada District. KFDV isolates were in a repository at the Indian National Institute of Virology in Prune India. "However, the virus was found to be highly infectious, as shown by the numerous infections in field and laboratory personnel which resulted in suspension of this work until an appropriate Biosafety Level 3 laboratory was built at NIV in 2004"

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Laboratory

Device or equipment involved: unknown; BSC

Procedure being performed: unknown; preparing inocula

How LAI / exposure occurred: First case: Unknown. Laboratory technician was diagnosed with M. tuberculosis. She had previously (6 weeks before) worked for three weeks in the mycobacterial department of the laboratory. No cases of tuberculosis were identified in friends or family, and the infection was considered to have been laboratory acquired. Second case: Laboratory technician (different technician) was preparing inocula from patient samples in a Class I safety cabinet. As he withdrew his arms from the cabinet, he scratched his left hand on the front window of the cabinet. This pierced his disposable latex glove and broke the skin on his hand. He subsequently developed swelling, redness and an induration at the site. Cultures identified M. tuberculosis, and the isolate was determined to be identical to three isolates from a patient handled by the technician on the day of the accident.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Single pair of protective gloves, Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Biological safety cabinet, Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: First case: Unknown. Second case: The abrasion was immediately cleaned with 70% ethanol.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The laboratory identified factors that may have contributed to inadequate compliance with safety guidelines. These included people entering the laboratory for reasons not related to mycobacterial work, slides for acid-fast staining were removed to another room for fixation and staining, and the air-conditioning in the laboratory was switched off during the night. Actions taken to address these issues included removing all equipment not needed for mycobacterial cultures from the room, restricting entrance to only staff working in the mycobacterial department, and reformulating safety regulations and discussing these regulations with everyone involved.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: First case: medical treatment, specifics unknown. Second case: anti-tuberculosis therapy, specifics unknown.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Laboratory

Device or equipment involved: screw-capped glass tube containing a culture in EMJH semi-solid medium

Procedure being performed: opening a screw-capped glass culture tube

How LAI / exposure occurred: The laboratory worker was opening a screw-capped glass tube containing a well-grown culture of leptospires in Ellinghausen McCullough Johnson Harris (EMJH) semi-solid medium. The tube broke and shrapnel cut through his disposable polythene gloves and into his hand. The cut was flooded with the culture from the broken tube.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Single pair of protective gloves, Unknown,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: The laboratory worker cleaned the wound with soap and water and left it open. The laboratory worker did not report the incident as instructed, and only revelaed the accident when he was interviewed during clinical examination, after symptoms appears on day 21. The strain from the laboratory worker showed a similar monoclonal antibody pattern to the strain of the isolate he was working with, and DNA anlaysis showed a 100% genetic similarity to the isolate.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: No clear actions are indicated, but the reference notes that the accident occurred due to the breakage of the glass tube while handling. In this lab, culture tubes are re-used after washing with cleaning fluid (10% potassium dichromate, 25% sulfuric acid, 75% distilled water) and sterilized in a hot air oven. The tube may have become brittle after repeated washing and sterilization, then broken when the laboratory worker attempted to unscrew the over-tight cap.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Symptoms appeared 21 days after the incident and he was treated with doxycycline. On day 23, he was admitted to a referral hospital, doxycycline was discontinued, and he was put on ciprofloxacin. He was eventaully discharged from the hospital but advised to complete the full course of antibiotic therapy.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: diagnostic laboratory

Device or equipment involved: 6-ft Type A, Class II BSC with thimble connection

Procedure being performed: Diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. Two-step procedure: sputum is incubated on growth medium and when growth occurs, cultures are prepared for confirmatory identification

How LAI / exposure occurred: Diagnostic activities with cultures were performed in a BSC. The cabinet had a failed HEPA filter, which was patched and later replaced. In addition, the BSC has a thimble connection above the cabinet that is connected to an exhaust fan on the roof. The roof fan was rated at 500 CFM and cabinet emits 500 CFM, that means some of the air from the cabinet spills back into the room, negating the safety feature of the thimble connection for a Type A BSC. There is no audible or visual alarm in the lab to signal if the roof fan is not operating. It was also found that the supply air to the lab is deficient relative to the exhaust requirements and there was serious doubt that the roof fan could ever reach the airflow volume of 500 CFM. The defective thimble system was identified as the source of exposure to the technician when the HEPA filter failed.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Biological safety cabinet, Other engineering control,

Follow-up procedures taken: The cabinet field certifiers need to test the entire system for correct function going forward, not just the cabinet alone. The cabinet had been repeatedly tested in the past by an accredited certifier who removed the thimble each time to verify the cabinet, but never measured the exhaust volume from the thimble. NSF standard 49, section F Field Tests does not call for the protective function of the thimble to be verified. The cabinet certifier can claim that the thimble system is maintained by the facility's HVAC personnel, but that should not prevent the cabinet certifier from verifying that the thimble system is functioning properly.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Had the cabinet certifier verified the thimble system was functioning correctly, they could have reported the deficiency to the facility representative and cabinet certification withheld until the entire system was made safe for use.

Procedure being performed: culturing of non-toxic Bacillus anthrax strain on chocolate culture medium containing sheep blood and sodium bicarbonate

How LAI / exposure occurred: During an undergraduate experiment, an anthrax vaccine strain was cultured. After incubation at 5% carbon dioxide for 20 h, a faculty member found a smooth colony on the plate and suspected that the strain recovered its virulence. The experiment was conducted in a common laboratory, defined as not BSL-2 or higher, and without a BSC. PPE worn was gowns, gloves, masks, but no other personal protection. PPE used was not sufficient to protect operations or environment if anthrax vaccine strain recovered its virulence. Upon receiving the incident response, a rapid investigation was undertaken and 12 samples were collected. No virulence recovery was identified and the university returned to normal functioning.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Wrap around gown, Single pair of protective gloves, Other PPE,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: At 12 noon on December 14, 2017, a faculty member reported the potential exposure to the CDC and subsequent reporting to the health bureaus, locals governments at country, prefectural and provincial levels for case investigation, evaluation and response. The entire process of emergency response took less than 50 h before exposure was ruled-out. After the first incident report was received, a rapid risk assessment was conducted including comprehensive emergency measures such as emergency closure of the laboratory, epidemiological investigation, field sampling, laboratory identification and analysis of the involved virulence genes, prophylaxis, medical observation, site disinfection, and biosafety survey of close contacts. The investigation results showed no virulence recovery, no contamination of Bacillus anthracis was detected, and the university returned to normal operations.

find in Risk Group Databasearrow (NOTE: you may have to edit search to be more specific)

Biological Safety Level (BSL) for work being performed?: unknown

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Not described, occurred while injecting S. schenckii into mice

Device or equipment involved: Previous small cut from glass, bandage contaminated by two drops of yeast suspension

Procedure being performed: Injecting S. schenckii into mice

How LAI / exposure occurred: The dermatologist was a 27 year old healthy male who had a small cut on the dorsa of the DIP joint of the right third finger from a piece of glass. The cut was immediately covered in a bandage, however, a few hours later, the bandage was contaminated by two drops of a suspension of the live yeast form of Sporothrix schenckii while he was injecting the yeast into mice.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: The dermatologist proceeded to to complete the mouse injections. Ten minutes later, the cut was thoroughly washed with running tap water and a new bandage was applied. The cut healed within the next 4 days, however on the 12th day after inoculation, a tender, intracutaneous nodule developed at the site of the cut and one week later there was a pustular change on the surface. The nodule gradually increased in size and became ulcerated. A small amount of purulent discharge was drained from the nodule. New nodules began to develop into the month of August on the right hand and forearm. Culture of the discharge from the lesion was positive for S. schenckii in pure culture on Sabouraud's glucose agar. The sporotrichin skin test was positive and PAD staining revealed yeast form fungi. Direct immunofluorescent study revealed S. schenckii in the tissue sections.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: It was not noted if gloves were worn, but had impermeable gloves been worn, the bandage would likely not have become contaminated.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: This was the first case reported in the Hokuriku district of Japan, the authors had never before seen sporotrichotic patients. Immediate therapy was withheld and the clinical course of the infection was observed daily. On August 13, potassium iodide (1.5g/day) was administered to a level of 3g/day for a period of 42 days. On September 11, the primary lesion had healed clinically, leaving a scar. A total dose of 123.5g of potassium iodide was administered. Relapse had not occurred up to 13 years later, but the dermatologist retained a positive sporotrichin test up to that date.

Procedure being performed: testing deer for tuberculosis and chronic wasting disease

How LAI / exposure occurred: The exact exposure is not known, but five members of a 10-person team had positive tuberculin tests after the 2019 hunting season. These Department of Natural Resources (DNR) workers test the heads of deer hunted in Michigan, looking for CWD and tuberculosis. They believe that the large number of deer harvested (almost 36,000 in 2018) overwhelmed the workflow, and that exposure resulted.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Safety glasses, N95, Other PPE,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: The department is reducing the number of deer tested each year, in order to reduce future exposure.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: unknown

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Workers are routinely tuberculin tested 6 months after deer season, and that is how these cases were identified. X-rays and other diagnostic procedures demonstrated that the infections were latent, not active. Antibiotics were provided. Respirators are now required for this work.

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Infected mosquito escaped in the laboratory while individual was preparing head squashes

Device or equipment involved: Unknown

Procedure being performed: Laboratorian was preparing head squashes of infected mosquitoes

How LAI / exposure occurred: Laboratorian received a bite from an infected mosquito that had been inoculated with sera specimens collected during the 1982 Delhi Dengue epidemic. One mosquito escaped and bit the laboratorian. The bite was noticed and the mosquito was killed.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: After the bite, blood was collected on day 1, 2nd and 27th post-infection. Female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were inoculated and some were fed on the laboratorian. Head squashes were prepared from infected mosquitoes for indirect immunofluorescence assays or complement fixation assays. Dengue type 2 was identified in mosquito suspension using complement fixation.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The possibility of laboratory-acquired infections through the bite of infected mosquitoes should be considered, therefore rigid safety precautions must be followed when utilizing the mosquito inoculation technique used for isolation and detection of Dengue Virus. One way to eliminate the risk of laboratory infection through an infective bite is to use non-biting mosquitoes like Toxorhynchites spp. However, the slow breeding and protracted life history of this mosquito make it difficult to get this species in enough quantities for experimental purposes.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: The laboratorian developed fever six days after infection through the mosquito bite. The fever was associated with chills, headache, body ache and joint pains. There was no rash or lymphadenopathy. Overall, the laboratorian had a mild illness and recovered.

Biological Safety Level (BSL) for work being performed?: unknown

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Clinical laboratory

Device or equipment involved: Unknown

Procedure being performed: The laboratorian was performing cytotoxicity assays with a culture of E. coli O157:H7 strain NZ 2149-92 isolated eight months before from a 6-yr old boy with gastroenteritis.To set up the assay, the laboratorian transferred a liquid culture stock of the bacteria after overnight expansion to a screw cap tube in the biosafety cabinet and wearing gloves. The culture was sonicated in a close cup horn sonifier system, followed by centrifugation. The supernatant was applied to Vero cells monolayers in a screw cap tubes (all done inside BSC and with gloves).

How LAI / exposure occurred: There was no evident exposure.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Single pair of protective gloves,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Biological safety cabinet,

Follow-up procedures taken: Four days after the manipulation, the laboratorian became ill with severe hemorrhagic colitis. The individual had a mean of seven bloody stools for two days with abdominal cramps. Diarrhea continued for one more week but it was not bloody. Fever was not recorded. The stool cultures showed abundant E. coli O157:H7 strain NZ 1676-92 and no other pathogen. Stool cultures were negative for E. coli O157:H7 after eight weeks. Since the strain identified in the laboratorian was different from the strain identified from the boy, additional testing was done to verify the toxin type and plasmid profile. Both tests confirmed that the strain that she had and the strain that she had been infected with were the same.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: There were no obvious errors in laboratory practice potentially generating a large inoculum for the technician. Thus, this report suggests that the inoculum of E. coli O157:H7 required to cause disease in humans is low.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: The individual did not receive antibiotics and recovered fully after 14 days.

While the authors agree that HPS is a risk when handling wild rodents, they note that the individuals who became ill were also residing in a cabin known to be infested by deer mice, who carry hantavirus species. They suggest that field conditions unrelated to rodent trapping may contribute to hantavirus infections in field workers.

Occupation(s) of affected personnel: Laboratorian

Age(s) of affected personnel: 31 yr old

Agent(s) involved: Sporothrix schenckii
find in Risk Group Databasearrow (NOTE: you may have to edit search to be more specific)

Biological Safety Level (BSL) for work being performed?: unknown

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Mycology Laboratory

Device or equipment involved: Biosafety Cabinet Class IIA, mortar and pestle

Procedure being performed: Laboratorian inoculated flasks of media with spore suspensions of S. schenckii; several days later. Cells were harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen, then ground in mortar with pestle.

How LAI / exposure occurred: Infection occurred in the absence of apparent trauma or other predisposing factors. There were no obvious cuts or abrasions on the skin. Gloves or other hand protection were not worn (specifically stated in the article)

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Not worn (specifically stated in article)

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Biological safety cabinet,

Follow-up procedures taken: Two weeks after handling the cultures in the BSC using the mortar and pestle, the laboratorian developed a subcutaneous abscess, light yellow, and with a darkened center on the tip of the middle finger of the right hand. The size of the abscess varied over time. A few days later, lymphadenopathy occurred and additional satellite lesions appeared within 1 cm of the original lesion.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The lack of gloves was described in the manuscript. The last point demonstrated in the report was that the infection developed in the absence of overt skin trauma which emphazises the need for laboratorians to use "extreme caution" when handling cultures of S. schenckii and associated materials. There have been three previous reports of S. schenckii infection of healthy skin, thus the use of protective clothing, including gloves, is indicated.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Laboratorian received oral potassium chloride (SSKI) after the additional lesions appeared for approximately two months. During the treatment course, white granules appeared and were shed from near the original site, perhaps reflecting transepidermal elimination of the fungus. Within one month of ceasing treatment, swelling occurred near the original lesion. The same treatment was restarted for additional two months. All symptoms resolved after the second round of treatment. A smear of the exudate from the primary lesion revealed budding yeast as well as the "cigar" shaped cells characteristic of S. schenckii.

Follow-up procedures taken: Case 1- The laboratorian was admitted to the hospital one week after the suspected exposure. The individual had contact with relatives in New York City while he was ill and before being admitted into the hospital. Stool cultures taken the day of admission and were positive for the Inaba strain of V. cholerae. However, stool samples collected during hospitalization tested positive for the Ogawa strain. On June 7th, the individual reported ill to his laboratory supervisor who immediately ordered the patient home to rest. On June 8th, the stool cultures were found to be positive for V. cholerae and he was hospitalized at Walter Reed General Hospital pending confirmation of the suspected diagnosis. Family members were hospitalized for five days for observation. Repeated cultures taken over this period of time were negative for all members. Case 2: The individual was admitted to the hospital three days after exposure (July 16th) due to multiple loose stools, abdominal cramps, and increased weakness.

Biological Safety Level (BSL) for work being performed?: unknown

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: research laboratory, animal room

Device or equipment involved: needle

Procedure being performed: inoculating mice

How LAI / exposure occurred: The researcher was inoculating mice with LCMV. She was placing a used syringe into the sharps bin, which was overfilled. While attempting to place the needle into the sharps bin, she stuck the needle into her left index finger.

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Not described,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: The wound was immediately washed and disinfected. The worker went to the university emergency room the same day, with no symptoms or abnormal blood test results. Because there is no known post-exposure prophylaxis, she was discharged and instructed to return if she became ill. After symptom onset, she regularly saw physicians, including being admitted to the hospital. The LAI was confirmed by PCR and antibody detection.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: Prevent the sharps container from being overfull.

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Immediate washing and disinfection of wound, medical care both before and after symptom onset.

Date(s) of LAI / exposure: Multiple LAIs between 2006 and 2017

Location where LAI / exposure occurred: Multiple cities in China

Occupation(s) of affected personnel: Housekeeping, pregnant laboratory technician, laboratory technicians, students, instructor

Age(s) of affected personnel: 27 individuals under 20; 7 between 20 and 50 yr; 2 > 50

Agent(s) involved: Brucella melitensis biovar
find in Risk Group Databasearrow (NOTE: you may have to edit search to be more specific)

Biological Safety Level (BSL) for work being performed?: unknown

Setting in which LAI / exposure occured: Clinical laboratories; handling of contaminated goat tissues

Device or equipment involved: Unknown

Procedure being performed: Handling of contaminated waste, handling of isolates, culture, bacterial identification, processed blood, processed sample suspected to have typhoid fever

How LAI / exposure occurred: Housekeeping: possibly handling contaminated waste Laboratory technicians: processing of samples outside the biosafety cabinet, technicians performed bacterial culture and bacterial identification, freezing and thawing samples. Students and instructor: handled tissues from goats which had not completed quarantine. The authors state that the potential routes of infections included direct contact (2 cases), aerosol transmission (2 cases), and both (28 cases). All LAIs occurred due to improper operations (for example not using biological safety cabinets, not wearing a mask or worn improperly, failing to quarantine experimental animals as required, etc.), inadequate biosafety training, and substandard laboratory safety conditions

PPE worn at the time of LAI / exposure: Lab coat, Single pair of protective gloves, Other PPE,

Engineering controls used at the time of the LAI / exposure: Unknown

Follow-up procedures taken: The authors state that in one instance the relevant department in the hospital did not pay attention to a Brucella diagnosis so the technician (A) was not notified; a second technician who processed the sample from technician A was not notified either.

Actions that may have been taken to prevent exposure: The authors state that the following factors influence occupational exposure: 1. Lack of biosafety management: departments of the hospital did not fully understand the risks associated with Brucella and did not take effective protective measures in a timely manner 2. Lack of biosafety awareness reflected in improper use of PPE, not using the biosafety cabinet, inappropriate handling of waste from clinical laboratories 3. Inappropriate containment reflected in laboratory technicians processing samples outside the biosafety cabinet 4. Unawareness of transmission route, for example generating aerosols 5. No vaccine is available

Post-exposure prophylaxis provided: Unknown
